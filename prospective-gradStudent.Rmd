# What graduate training areas can I apply to in order to join the Developmental Psychopathology Lab?

Prospective graduate students interested in joining the lab can apply to <ins>***any***</ins> of the [graduate training areas](https://psychology.uiowa.edu/graduate-program) of the Department:

- [Clinical Science](https://psychology.uiowa.edu/research/clinical-science)
- [Individualized Graduate Training Track](https://psychology.uiowa.edu/graduate-program/individualized-graduate-training-track)
- [Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience](https://psychology.uiowa.edu/research/behavioral-cognitive-neuroscience)
- [Cognition](https://psychology.uiowa.edu/research/cognition)

Students are welcome to join one of various departmental research groups.
Research groups provide individualized, interdisciplinary, and student-centered research training in that domain.
Dr. Petersen is a member of the following research groups:

- [Developmental Psychopathology](https://psychology.uiowa.edu/research/developmental-psychopathology)
- [Developmental Science](https://psychology.uiowa.edu/research/developmental-science)
- [Cognitive Control](https://psychology.uiowa.edu/research/cognitive-control)

Students who are interested in joining the [Developmental Psychopathology Research Group](https://psychology.uiowa.edu/research/developmental-psychopathology) and who do not want clinical training are encouraged to apply to the [Individualized Graduate Training Track](https://psychology.uiowa.edu/graduate-program/individualized-graduate-training-track).

# Criteria used for evaluation of graduate applications

Your application will be reviewed closely by me and by the relevant training area.
So you have a sense of how graduate applications are evaluated, here are the criteria that I consider most strongly when evaluating applicants for graduate school and my lab:

- fit of interests with the Developmental Psychopathology Lab
- fit of career goals with the mission of the program and the relevant training area
    - i.e., career goals in research
- evidence of high-quality, independent research experience
    - e.g., Honors project, senior thesis, independent research project, first-authored peer-reviewed publications, first-authored posters or talks at national or international conferences, grant/fellowship submissions—these are just examples (you are not expected to have all of these!)
- writing skills, especially in scientific writing
- quantitative/statistical skills
- academic preparedness for graduate school

# The current focus of the Developmental Psychopathology Lab {#currentFocus}

The broader mission of the Developmental Psychopathology Lab is to advance understanding of how self-regulation develops so that we as a society can better treat or even prevent the development of externalizing problems.
To this aim, the focal project of the lab’s work is an ongoing longitudinal study, the School Readiness Study, that follows children from 3–7 years of age to better understand how self-regulation and externalizing problems develop, from a bio-psycho-social perspective.
In this project, we place special emphasis on the development of neural functioning, as measured by EEG/ERP, and how neural development influences the development of children's self-regulation and externalizing problems.
For more information on the study, you are encouraged to read papers from the project, view the available measures, examine the Data Dictionary, and see the pre-registered hypotheses.
These resources are available on the School Readiness Study project page of the Open Science Framework (OSF): https://osf.io/jzxb8.

# Am I a good fit for the Developmental Psychopathology Lab?

Our program does not look for “mini-me”s whose interests are exactly the same as ours; at the same time, we do look for a core fit of research interests with the direction of the prospective lab(s).
Different labs have different structures.
In some labs, graduate students conduct separate independent research projects.
My lab has a different structure.
We are conducting a large longitudinal project funded by the National Institutes of Health.
Work of this scope takes a village.
Thus, my lab’s structure is “all hands on deck”—everyone (including research assistants, graduate students, lab staff, and me) contributes to the same large project.
This leads to a highly collaborative environment in which we can be more productive together.
Within the broader umbrella of our large longitudinal study, graduate students carve out their unique niche.
Graduate students in my lab lead projects that are part of the broader study.
As a result, to be a good fit for my lab, it is important that your interests align with our current study and work.
In general, I look for graduate students who will “hit the ground running” in my lab, in terms of data analysis and writing papers, and whose interests closely align with the lab’s current study and focus (as described [above](#currentFocus)).
 
# What to do before applying

Before applying, I encourage you to:

1. Read the [lab expectations for graduate students](https://devpsylab.github.io/LabWiki/expectations-gradStudent.html) to make sure the lab would be a good fit for you.
1. Contact [Dr. Petersen](https://psychology.uiowa.edu/people/isaac-petersen) by email for more information about the lab; express your interests and send your CV to see if the lab would be a good fit for your interests.

# What to do when applying

To make your application as strong as possible, I encourage you to:

1. Make sure your application—including your CV, professional statement, letters of recommendation, coursework, experiences, writing sample, etc.—addresses the above criteria used for evaluation of applications.
1. Include a writing sample in your application (separate from your professional statement).
It is preferable for the writing sample to be an example of scientific writing (e.g., APA-style manuscript), and for you to be the sole- or lead-author.

# What to include in the Professional Statement as part of the application

I find it helpful when applicants include the following in their professional statements[^1]:

1. A clear statement of your general research interests and how they relate to our lab’s mission and work
1. A clear statement of why you are interested in this lab, in particular, versus other labs that study the development of self-regulation and externalizing problems
1. A statement about your career goals (even if they are approximate/might change, it is helpful to see your thinking!), including the activities and context(s) of interest
1. Discussions of your independent research experience(s) and what you learned from them.
In these discussions, I suggest emphasizing (1) the skills you developed from working on each project (e.g., data collection; behavioral coding; statistical analysis; computer programming; neural or biopsychology methods such as EEG/ERP; software such as R, REDCap, MATLAB, E-Prime, and Datavyu; writing certain sections of a paper; submitting/presenting a poster), and (2) what your "takeaways" were from the project—e.g., new research ideas or questions your work inspired.
