## Best Practices

Adapted from [here](https://github.com/lowepowerlab/protocols/blob/main/markdown_best_practices.md):

- **Use a new line for every sentence.** 
This helps with version control—individually changed sentences will be highlighted upon commits (easy to parse) rather than whole paragraphs (nightmare to parse).
    - This formatting is incompatible with a double space after a period.
    Instead, use a single space after a period.
    To replace all double spaces with single spaces, do a find and replace for `".  "` → `". "` 
    Be careful not to blanket remove all double spaces because tabbed bullets have 3 spaces. 

- Add protocol entries as links to the `README.md`

- Add linked content (e.g. images) to sub-directories

- Use no spaces in file or folder names.
Use a dash (-) instead of a space.

- If you use `Visual Studio Code` to edit the Lab Wiki, you can view the source code side-by-side with the markdown Preview (after selecting the code type as `markdown`):

- When making numbered (ordered) lists, just use `1. ` for all numbers. 
Markdown will make them sequential automatically.
This is helpful if you go back and add additional entries later. 

- Use `"[XXX]"` to indicate an area that needs editing.
This will allow the lab to `CTRL+F` for `"[XXX]"` and find areas that need editing.

- To update the list of `R` packages that are installed for running the `.Rmd` files, update the `DESCRIPTION` file.

## Updating

To update the lab wiki, perform the following steps:

1. (Perform this step if you do not already have the the [LabWiki `GitHub` repo](https://github.com/DevPsyLab/LabWiki) on your local machine:) Clone the `GitHub` repo to your local machine.
1. Fetch the latest version of the repo.
It is important to do this to make sure you have the latest version locally before making any changes.
1. Edit the relevant `.Rmd` files using `RStudio` or `Visual Studio Code`,
1. Commit the changes.
1. Push the changes to the `GitHub` repo.
After pushing the changes to the `GitHub` repo, GitHub Actions will automatically re-run the code and deploy the updated website, assuming there were no errors.
You can track the workflow for errors here: https://github.com/DevPsyLab/LabWiki/actions.
