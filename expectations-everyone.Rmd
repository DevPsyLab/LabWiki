title: "Lab Expectations for Everyone"
---

Everyone is expected to follow our [mission statements](https://devpsylab.github.io/LabWiki/manual.html#missionStatement), including our [internal](https://devpsylab.github.io/LabWiki/manual.html#missionStatement-internal) and [external](https://devpsylab.github.io/LabWiki/manual.html#missionStatement-external) mission statement, in addition to our our [diversity statement](https://devpsylab.github.io/LabWiki/manual.html#diversityStatement).

# Dress Code {#dressCode}

Everyone is expected to follow a "casual professional" dress code while in lab. Jeans and denim capris are acceptable, as long as they are not ripped or frayed. T-shirts without inappropriate graphics, text, cut-outs, etc. are acceptable. Leggings are permitted if they are worn as tights (i.e., under a skirt, dress, shorts, or long shirt that fully covers the bottom). Shorts are permitted if they are twill or chino material and reach *at least* to your mid-thigh (Bermuda-length shorts, however, are more appropriate). The following are NOT allowed: open-toed shoes, short-shorts, low-cut shirts, visible undergarments (including bralettes and sports bras), or workout/gym clothes (e.g., sweatpants, yoga pants). For guidance on shorts guidelines, see the [DevPsy Lab Summerwear Guide](#summerwear) (below).

# Professionalism

Everyone is expected to act professionally.
This is especially critical when participants are in the lab.
When a participant is in the lab, they should not be able to hear anyone in either the observation room or the lab offices.
In longitudinal research, each visit is exponentially more important than the last.
Treating participants like royalty is not only the right thing to do, but significantly increases the likelihood of retention.

# Role-Specific Expectations

In addition, people are expected to follow their expectations for the role, including expectations for [undergraduate research assistants](https://devpsylab.github.io/LabWiki/expectations-undergradRA.html), [graduate students](https://devpsylab.github.io/LabWiki/expectations-gradStudent.html), [postdoctoral scholars](https://devpsylab.github.io/LabWiki/expectations-postdoc.html), and [lab staff](https://devpsylab.github.io/LabWiki/expectations-labStaff.html).
