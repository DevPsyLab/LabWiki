I have read and understand the above expectations, in addition to the [lab manual](https://devpsylab.github.io/LabWiki/manual.html) and the section on [expectations for everyone in the lab](https://devpsylab.github.io/LabWiki/expectations-everyone.html).
I agree to meet these expectations and to ask Dr. Petersen if I need clarification on any of the expectations and systems of lab.
