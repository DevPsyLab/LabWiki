# Signature

I have read and understand the above expectations, in addition to the expectations outlined in the [lab manual](manual.html) and the section on [expectations for everyone in the lab](expectations-everyone.html).
I agree to meet these expectations and to ask Dr. Petersen if I need clarification on any of the expectations and systems of lab.
