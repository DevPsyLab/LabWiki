# Your Schedule {#schedule}

Here are the expectations regarding your schedule:

- You are in the office for your designated hours per week that are regularly scheduled between 9am–5pm Monday through Friday.
- You may have to work outside those hours (early mornings/evenings/weekends) for the purpose of running participants.
- You get approval from me for any deviations from this schedule (working outside those hours, working more than your designated hours, etc.), and update your schedule accordingly in the online calendar.
- You will log all hours worked using your Employee Self Service and submit them to the Lab Coordinator
- The position involves fully in-person work.
- You let me and the relevant team members know by Slack if you will not be able to make it in for your regularly scheduled hours.
- All information that is team relevant should be in Slack
- Personal communication (e.g., asking for time off) may be emailed
- You let me and the relevant team members know in person or by Slack if you are leaving the office (running lab errands, etc.).
- You keep your schedule in the online calendar up-to-date with any changes.
- For time off, you get my approval with as much advance notice as possible—and at least 24 hours in advance, if at all possible.

# Communication {#communication}

- You respond to team members promptly by email, Slack, or in person (within one business day).
If you need time to gather information in response to a Slack message or email, please acknowledge receipt of the message and indicate when you will be able to provide the requested information.
At times, I may contact you by email or Slack after hours (if that is when it is most convenient, so that I do not forget to).
However, you are \*not\* expected to respond after hours.
I will call you if something is urgent.
