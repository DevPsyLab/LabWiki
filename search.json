    "section": "4.1 Research projects and training",
    "text": "4.1 Research projects and training\nTake advantage of your opportunity to work at a world-class university by developing and refining stellar scientific skills. I expect that you will learn how to plan, design, and conduct high-quality scientific research.\nI expect all trainees to maintain good progress on their projects. This includes: keeping updated on the literature and research methods, actively thinking about the best ways to conduct your research projects and applying them, regularly discussing your research progress with me, following the plans based on our discussions, and presenting (conferences, presentations, and/or journal articles) the findings at a satisfactory level. Writing is the single most important ability to develop during graduate school. I expect you to write frequently, and I encourage you to write daily. I encourage students to read Paul Silva’s “How to Write a Lot (archived at https://perma.cc/C6XV-84UR),” and I am happy to lend the book to you. I encourage you to use EndNote, Zotero, or another reference manager to manage your references and write the References section of papers. Reference management software will save you lots of time. Additionally, please follow the lab’s writing guidelines.\nMy expectation is that you will be engaged in research activities beyond those required by the program. Have multiple research projects to work on. Having multiple ongoing projects provides important diversification—if a given project is not working out as expected, you have other projects you can turn to. But focus and finish. The “currency” in science is published papers—they drive a lot of what we do. Because our lab is supported by taxpayer dollars, we have an obligation to complete and disseminate our findings. I expect you to lead first-authored projects (in addition to any collaborative projects) and to publish your work in high-impact journals. It is my policy that students are first-author on all work for which they lead the data analysis and writing. I will push you to publish your research as you move through your training program, not only at the end. I expect trainees to be lead author on at least two journal paper submissions, preferably three or four (or more!). Productivity in terms of publishing high-quality papers and securing funding is crucial to be competitive for many jobs.\nI expect you to apply for external funding—examples include the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF-GRFP) and the National Institutes of Health National Research Service Award (NIH NRSA F31). I encourage students to submit a NSF-GRFP in their first semester. I encourage students to submit a NIH NRSA (F31) in their second or third year. Getting a first-authored publication in your first or second year is important for these (and other) fellowships and for awards.\nFor many jobs, presentation skills are also highly important, including skills in presenting research to broad audiences of scientists outside of your area. For academic positions, while papers and grants “get your foot in the door” and help you get an interview, the “job talk” (typically to the whole Department) is the single most important criterion during a job interview—because that is the one thing that all faculty see. Thus, I expect you to present your research frequently and in multiple outlets. Challenge yourself by presenting your work at meetings and seminars as early as you can. I also expect you to go to Departmental colloquia series by speakers who are outside of your area.\nWe will have meetings to discuss the research project(s) you find interesting that also advance the lab’s interests. I always welcome new ideas and project proposals, so please come to me if you want to discuss new projects. A piece of advice that was given to me as a graduate student that I pass onto you is to find a question or problem that excites you and “date” it. You will know that you have found an idea that truly excites you when you find yourself thinking about it while brushing your teeth, going for walks, etc. Much of the important and exciting work in science happens at the ideas stage."

Identifiable electronic data should be stored only on the lab’s RDSS share and should not be saved onto your computer. When working from private spaces, the university VPN can be accessed to ensure a secure internet connection.\nYou are expected to maintain detailed, organized, and accurate laboratory records in a lab notebook. Be aware that all tangible research data and related research materials are my property as the lab director. When you leave the lab, I encourage you to retain access to the lab’s research data via VPN to the lab drive (RDSS share). One full set of all data must stay in the lab, with appropriate and accessible documentation. Regularly back up the files on your computer using Microsoft OneDrive, which is provided by the university.

When ethical dilemmas or uncertainties arise, ask me and others for guidance. Consult, consult, consult!\nIn this lab, we work hard to do the best science we can. During the process, obstacles and frustrations are inevitable, and sometimes more common than you would imagine. It is my hope that we will work together to tackle these challenges and to build up your resilience. To this end, please keep me updated on your progress—both the good and bad.\nMistakes are inevitable and are part of your training, so do not feel bad about making mistakes—I make mistakes on a daily basis. I strive for the lab to provide a supportive environment to ask questions and admit mistakes. As your mentor, I am also responsible for your research and training. So please do let me know if such things happen and we will work together to recover from them. Usually the earlier you inform me, the less damage there will be. Being frank about your mistakes will be greatly appreciated. However, things like intentionally faking data and intentionally covering mistakes are unacceptable and will lead to severe consequences."

    "section": "4.4 Time in lab",
    "text": "4.4 Time in lab\nI expect you to be at work and on campus during the workday: 9ish–5ish or 8ish–4ish. In addition, I expect your availability to span 9–5 for scheduling meetings with me or members of the team—the same hours, generally, that the program attempts to schedule meetings. During the workday, you are expected to work in the lab when you are not in class, teaching, or doing clinical work. This is not about accountability—rather, it is to the benefit of you and the team. Our approach is optimal for the type of projects we carry out: longitudinal projects such as ours are one big enterprise with many moving parts, all of which have to work together smoothly. Each student’s individual project is embedded in that larger umbrella (retaining each student’s uniqueness, ideas, etc.). Thus, the physical interactions for the whole team, in one space, with shared work ethic, are so important. Part of your job is to be in the lab (with your door open) and to talk with other people about your research. We all benefit from having a group of people we can talk with about research questions and problems. We have a collaborative lab environment. Our lab works as a team, and other lab members count on you being there. Likewise, you benefit from having other team members, myself, and Departmental staff available. Working in the lab space helps improve quality control of lab procedures and can lead to exciting collaborative projects. This short blurb on how “Isolation is one of the biggest enemies of graduate students” (archived at https://perma.cc/GK56-7LLW) may give you some insight why facetime in the lab is so important:\n\n“I wonder how an English professor would feel spending a week in a physics lab. Not about the scientific work, but about the frequent, ongoing interaction between students and peers, post-docs and faculty. Scientists see each other in the lab, if not daily, then at least weekly. They have frequent lab meetings, colloquia and interaction with scholars at other universities around joint research. During my graduate training in psychology at McGill University, especially in the research lab at the Montreal Neurological Institute, I spent hours hanging around the post-docs. I learned at least as much from them as I did from my interactions with my professors. The expectation was that I would be at the lab 9 to 5 or more, every day. I saw my adviser every day.” – Gina Hiatt\n\nOf course, there are exceptions; if you are sick, stay home. You do not need my permission to attend medical appointments during lab hours. If you are unable to come into lab due to bad weather, just let me know and you should be available to be reach-able quickly, just as you would be if you were in lab.\nNevertheless, graduate school is not a 40 hour per week job. Graduate students can expect to work an average of 50 hours per week. Outside of the workday, you are welcome to work from the lab, or—as long as you ensure confidentiality of data—from home or from other spaces. That said, the most important thing is for you to get the job done—you are in your career now and are investing in yourself. Graduate research requires full-time dedication and year-round effort.\nDiscuss policies on work hours, sick leave, and vacation with me directly. It is important to take time off to decompress from time to time. Work-life balance and vacation time are essential for creative thinking and good health, and I encourage you to take regular vacations. You can take three weeks of vacation time each year, and you are not expected to work during university holidays. In addition, I do not expect students to work between mid-December (i.e., after the end of the Fall semester) and the first week of January. Please discuss your vacation plans with me before booking your trip. Submit requests for time off in person, by phone, or via email, not by Discord. Consult with me and notify fellow lab members in advance of any planned absences, with as much advance notice as possible—at least two weeks’ notice or more if feasible. Please plan that if you are away, others will need to take over your responsibilities, so planning for adequate lead time and training may be necessary. Please discuss with me if you plan to take a summer internship or bootcamp."

    "text": "4.5 Meetings\nThere are three types of meetings: lab meetings, group meetings, and one-on-one meetings. Lab meetings occur weekly. All lab members are expected to attend. Typical forms of lab meetings are article discussions (led by one lab member), project presentations, talks given by guest speakers, and professional development workshops. You should read these materials in advance. You are expected to contribute with questions and/or comments during lab meetings. The university and our lab use Outlook for scheduling; you are expected to keep your university Outlook account up to date.\nOne-on-one meetings are 45-min, weekly meetings between each trainee and me. You can also schedule one-off one-on-one meetings with me. When scheduling your one-on-one and other meetings, send all of your available times (between 9am and 5pm), not just your preferred times! You may indicate which of your available times are preferred or less preferred. One-on-one meetings are designed for us to discuss any training and research-related issues in detail and to form plans for the near future, in addition to any challenges. Make sure that you also use this time to communicate new ideas that you have about your work and challenges that you are facing. Remember: I cannot address or advise about issues that you do not bring to my attention. I expect trainees to attend all their one-on-one meetings. I understand that sometimes there is nothing to report, so occasional cancellation is fine. That said, note that even if you have nothing to report, sometimes having the meeting can still be advantageous and it may be worth our time to still check in. Do not cancel meetings with me if you feel that you have not made adequate progress on your research; these might be the most critical times to meet with a mentor.\nYou are expected to ask questions, stay on task, and take notes during meetings. Be respectful of my time and make any necessary changes (to papers, analysis code, etc.) after the meeting, based on your notes and on your own time—unless I am working on the document directly.\nBesides meetings, trainees are welcome to drop by my office anytime to discuss research, training, and administration-related issues. I have an open-door policy: my door is always open (figuratively speaking). I will be happy to meet with you as long as I do not have another obligation. My office and phone number is: [see my University page]. My cell is: [blinded for the internet…just ask]."

Your education is your responsibility—you have the primary responsibility for the successful completion of your degree. I encourage you to follow the recommended timelines for research, coursework, and clinical work (see the Appendix). You should maintain a high level of professionalism, self-motivation, engagement, scientific curiosity, and ethical standards. You should also be knowledgeable of and comply with all policies, deadlines, and requirements of the graduate program, the graduate college, and the university. Further, I expect you to actively cultivate your professional development. UI has outstanding resources in place to support professional development for students, including professional development seminars and workshops on topics such as oral communication, scientific writing, collaborative research, statistical methods, teaching, and mentoring. I expect you to take advantage of these resources. You are also encouraged to talk with other members of the lab, other students, and faculty to learn ways of effectively navigating graduate school.\nAvoid clinical clique-ishness and insularity. The most innovative science transcends traditional boundaries. I expect you to spend time and talk science with graduate students and faculty in areas outside of clinical (e.g., BCN, cognition)—both to broaden your perspectives and to incorporate basic science perspectives into your work, while also being a good Departmental citizen. Clinical students at some programs wrongly think they are special and think of their work as superior to basic science. Clinical science is not a research area—clinical science uses basic science (e.g., cognitive, social, developmental, biological science) in rigorous ways to answer clinically relevant questions.\nI expect all trainees to comply with their respective training plans (e.g., training plans of your degree program), such as taking required courses, maintaining passing grades, fulfilling teaching assistant duties, clinical training, and organizing committee meetings. You are expected to attend and actively participate in all group meetings and in seminars that are part of your educational program. I expect you to attend conferences, as well as meetings of the lab (including Data Team and lab meetings), the Area (e.g., Clinical Science Area Rounds), the Department (including the Friday Departmental colloquia series and other relevant brownbags such as Cognition and Behavioral & Cognitive Neuroscience [BCN]), and the University (including the DeLTA Center and Iowa Neuroscience Institute [INI]). When we go to conferences, I will introduce you to my professional network and encourage you to build skills in networking.\nWe will discuss your training and career development plans. All program requirements are in the Department’s Graduate Handbook and/or the Graduate College’s Manual of Rules and Regulations. I include a suggested timeline for your research, clinical training, and coursework below. Please consult with me before selecting your courses, clinical practica, and other time-intensive training experiences.\nFor some students, there may be relevant training fellowships. For instance, the Behavioral-Biomedical Interface Training Program (BBIP) provides training in bio-medical research.\nThis is a research-oriented program; you are expected to prioritize research relative to your other obligations. If you are getting all As in classes, you are spending too much time on coursework! Grades in grad school don’t matter (as long as you pass your classes; archived at https://perma.cc/KDU2-79JZ), and the sooner you figure that out, the better off and more productive you will be. Instead of focusing your learning on coursework, learn by doing. Take what you need from classes to advance your research program.\nPlease refer to the Clinic Manual for guidelines regarding face-to-face hours (on the clinic drive5: \\\\iowa.uiowa.edu\\shared\\CLAS\\Departmental\\PBS\\Clinic\\Clinic Manual\\). For clinical students, it is important to regularly track your clinical experiences and hours to ensure that you are meeting appropriate milestones in your training. The program has an institutional account for Time2Track. You are expected to use it to track hours and are expected to stay caught up in your tracking. We will discuss your plans for clinical training and practicum opportunities during our regular individual meetings. I will also provide clinical supervision of some of your cases as part of the Seashore Clinic. I am a licensed clinical psychologist, so assessment hours in my research lab count as clinical hours."

We also use MATLAB for processing of event-related potential data and Mplus for structural equation modeling. You are encouraged to learn R and any other specialized software that will allow you to answer the research questions you are pursuing. If there’s another tool or software package that can do something easier, better, more efficiently, or with greater reproducibility than what we are using, feel free to use it—though I may not be able to provide formal guidance. For instance, Python is a free programming language that is emerging as a nice complement to R for statistical programming.

I expect you to use version control (git with GitLab) with all projects and to save your lab projects in a repo on the lab’s GitLab page. Commit and push your work to the GitLab repo often. Using version control provides many benefits: (a) it provides backups of all files in the cloud, (b) it allows you to access the files in the cloud from any computer with access to the internet, even if you are away from your local computer, (c) it provides history of all (committed) changes made to all files. If you make a mistake in your code, you can easily revert to a prior version because you took snapshots (commits) of your files! (d) It allows you to write cleaner code because you do not need to keep all the old, “commented out” lines of code, (e) it helps with project organization; you no longer have to keep files or folders named “project_old” (or “project_2”, “project_final” (archived at https://perma.cc/3Q5D-XKTJ), or whatever), (f) it keeps all files for the project self-contained, which helps increase reproducibility, and (g) it allows easier collaboration with others on the project."

Strive to be the very best lab citizen and citizen of the Department and University. Regardless of your source of funding (e.g., teaching assistantship, research assistantship, fellowship/grant), you can expect lab-related assignments that are for the betterment of the team. For instance, I expect you to supervise a coding task. I expect you to learn the lab procedures and protocols. You should be able to train research assistants or lab staff on various procedures. I expect you to work to ensure quality control of lab procedures so that we are collecting and processing high-quality data in an efficient way. I expect you to help other team members, including undergraduate research assistants with independent research projects, Honors projects and theses, job or graduate applications/interviews, etc. Doing so will help you build important skills in mentoring.\nRegardless of your source of funding, you are expected to spend most of your time doing lab-related research. If you are funded on a research assistantship from the lab, I expect you will spend at least 20 hours (for a full-time assistantship; at least 10 hours for a half-time assistantship) doing lab-related research from the relevant grant(s) and lab-assigned work that is separate from coursework, clinical work, work toward program requirements (e.g., Comps exams), other research-related work, and other endeavors. This is an ethical obligation given our federal sources of funding. If you are unable to commit to a full research load (and therefore would not be able to meet the expectations of a research assistantship), you should tell me before assistantships are assigned, so you can be given a teaching assistantship or another source of funding. Nevertheless, even with a teaching assistantship, you are expected to spend most of your time doing lab-related research. You should not spend more than 10 hours per week doing teaching-related work for a half-time teaching assistantship, and not more than 20 hours for a full-time teaching assistantship (and generally much less than that).\nYou should talk with me and get my approval before doing or adding any external practica. Per lab and program expectations, you should not spend more than 1.5 full days (i.e., 12 hours) doing clinic-related work per week. Do not focus too much on clinical hours; Ph.D. students from non-clinical science programs and Psy.D. students will have way more clinical hours than you—you are not competing with them for the same types of sites. You will be most competitive at clinical science internship sites (archived at https://perma.cc/2VRK-JRMQ), which care much more about the quality of training than the quantity of training. And UI has top-notch clinical training. Internship sites also care heavily about scientific productivity including publications (Lund et al., 2016), and this is even more true for clinical science internship sites. I had four first-authored publications (nine total) and an NRSA when I applied for internship and received 13 interview invitations out of 15 sites. I am happy to share my preparation, application, and interview materials etc. for internships, jobs, etc. and to work with you to make them as strong as possible.\nPlease do not hide in your office; get out and meet people at group and departmental events. If a colloquium is given in an area in which you have a research interest, sign up to meet with the speaker. Go up to speakers after talks, introduce yourself, and express interest in their work by asking questions. Networking skills are important and can often lead to job opportunities."

For prospective graduate students, if you have goals of being a clinician, I would dissuade you from joining our program and this lab; you would not be happy here.\nWe will discuss your career development plans and how I can best support them. During each Fall semester, I expect you to complete an Individual Development Plan (https://myidp.sciencecareers.org; archived at https://perma.cc/MT27-CPP2), and to review and discuss the results with me. I expect you to inform me if there is any change in your career plans so that your lab activities can be better aligned to your new goals. In addition to academic careers (e.g., research/teaching/clinical work at R1 university, academic medical center, or liberal arts college), I support plans for industry and non-academic careers (e.g., data science, consulting, government, NGO; these are just examples—there are many others). You are welcome to get the training you need, provided that you maintain good progress on your degree-related training and research. Seek the experience of faculty, professionals, post-docs, and other students to help you out.\nIf you want an academic job, I know what it takes to get one (in terms of publications, grants, etc.), so just ask. I am also happy to talk with you about what an R1 academic job is like (e.g., setting up and running a lab, teaching)—I love my job and have a passion for the work we do. I get to be part of an invigorating intellectual environment in which I get to learn every day, get to be around exciting ideas and world-renowned experts conducting cutting-edge research, and have the intellectual freedom to get paid to study whatever I want to study.

Early on in your training, I aim to provide sufficient structure and scaffolding. As you develop proficiency in a skill, I strive to withdraw the scaffolds so that you develop independence and autonomy. The second approach to my mentorship style is an emphasis on learning by doing. I encourage students to learn by applying the skills to projects they are working on in the lab, rather than relying on coursework and other methods. I view my role as fostering your professional confidence and encouraging your critical thinking, skepticism, and creativity.\nDo not hesitate to ask questions if I am around; it is often better to ask questions than to make a mistake that could have been easily avoided. I am periodically away, and I expect you to get things done well without me. You are encouraged to be independent; do not be afraid to try to do detective work on your own if I am not around. There is also a benefit to learning by trial and error. We have a helpful, experienced lab, so know that people other than me may be excellent resources.\nIn order for supervision to be effective, I hope that our relationship will include open communication and two-way feedback. If there are ways I can be a better mentor for you, please let me know. I value openness to learning as a continuous, developmental, life-long process and I will model and promote openness and receptivity to feedback. I expect that trainees will express disagreements and differences in opinion with me. I do not view professional disagreements as personal; the best science arises out of the free and constructive exchange of multiple perspectives and ideas. I expect that trainees will attempt to address conflicts in the mentor–mentee relationship.\nI strive to build and to support a diverse team, to treat people equitably, and to be inclusive of people from all backgrounds. If there are things that the lab or I can do to help you or others feel more included, please let me know.\nI am committed to mentoring you, even after you leave my lab. I am committed to your education and training while you are in my lab, and to advising and guiding your career development—to the extent you wish—long after you leave. I will provide honest letters of evaluation for you when you request them."

    "section": "4.15 Communication",
    "text": "4.15 Communication\nFeel free to use Discord for brief communication with me. However, we do not use direct messages in Discord (see the lab manual). All Discord communication should be in team-facing channels so others can benefit from the information and so we can go back and reference it later. For longer communication, please call or stop by my office. I find this much more efficient and pleasant than writing and reading lengthy communication. For sending manuscripts, personal information, and messages that do not need an urgent response, you may email me. Please limit your use of email as much as possible. I hate email (archived at https://perma.cc/T855-U9MQ); we get way too much of it, it is impersonal, it does not communicate tone well (often leading to misinterpretation and sometimes hurt feelings), and it is difficult for me to stay on top of my inbox. I encourage you to stop by my office or to call my office phone instead of relying on email, whenever possible.\nWhen you contact me or send me materials, you can expect me to respond promptly. Likewise, I expect you to respond promptly when I or another lab member contacts you (in most cases, within 48 hours). If you need time to gather information in response to a Discord message or email, please acknowledge receipt of the message and indicate when you will be able to provide the requested information. At times, I may contact you by email or Discord after hours (if that is when it is most convenient, so that I do not forget to). However, you are *not* expected to respond after hours. I will call you if something is urgent.\nBe mindful of the constraints on my time. Allow a minimum of one week prior to submission deadlines for me to read and respond to short materials such as conference abstracts and three weeks for me to work on manuscripts, grant proposals, and letters of recommendation. Please do not assume I can read materials within a day or two, especially when I am traveling. Please only send drafts of manuscripts, grant proposals, dissertations, etc. when they are your best possible work (the Henry Kissinger criterion). That means going through multiple revisions, printing it and reading it out loud to yourself, etc. Here is an excerpt about Dr. Kissinger (Krausman, 2021):\n\n“Henry Kissinger, a former Secretary of State under President Nixon, understood the importance of continually improving writing skills. Winston Lord was Kissinger’s speech writer and during the late 1960s and early 1970s, Lord had been tasked with writing a speech about three important foreign policy projects: the opening of China to the West, bringing the Vietnam War to a close, and an attempt to improve relations with the Russians. Writing a speech for Kissinger was not an easy job because Kissinger was a speech writer himself and harsh critic.\nThe story goes that Lord prepared and submitted a first draft of a speech to Kissinger one evening. Kissinger then called Lord the next morning for feedback on the speech and asks “Is this the best you can do?”\nLord replies “Henry, I thought so, but I’ll try again.”\nLord then went back to the drawing board, tweaked, revised, and resubmitted another draft a few days later.\nThe next day, Kissinger called Lord into his office and again asked “Are you sure this is the best you can do?”\nLord began to question his work and said “Well, I really thought so. I’ll try again.”\nBelieve it or not, this uncomfortable and rejecting process went on for 8 drafts, each time Kissinger standing firm to his original feedback of “Is this the best you can do?”\nLord returned to Kissinger’s office with the now ninth draft and awaited his response.\nSurely enough, Kissinger called Lord in the next day and asks him the same question, “Is this the best you can do?”\nLord, now completely fed up, furiously replied “Henry! I’ve beaten my brains out—this is the ninth draft! I know it’s the best I can do; I can’t possibly improve one more word!!!”\nKissinger then looked at Lord and nonchalantly said “Well, in that case, now I’ll read it.”"

We are a group of researchers working toward a common goal, and all members are encouraged to work together collaboratively. A rising tide lifts all boats. Competitive behavior is not conducive to a productive laboratory, and this sort of behavior will strictly not be tolerated. Do not compare yourself to others. You are on your own path. Each mentee needs different things, and I will do my best to get to know you as an individual, and your individual skills, preferences, and goals. Cultivating a common value of humility is important in research, because we are always asking questions to which we inherently do not know the answer. Elitist behavior is not conducive to growth and development, and as such, is not appropriate for the lab environment. The lab culture is of utmost importance to a healthy, functional group, and professional behavior is at the center of building this culture. If you have joined the lab, you have been selected among many qualified applicants for this position. I encourage you to share your thoughts and ideas with the lab. Keeping them to yourself would be a disservice to the team."

Please also speak to me if you think you have an interpersonal issue with me.

You are also encouraged to seek professional help—it is not a sign of weakness; it is a sign of you taking care of yourself.\nRemember that all of us are “new” at various points in our careers. Imposter syndrome is normal; I encourage you to adopt a growth mindset. You are meant to be here! Failure is common in academia. Take a look at the CV of Failures (archived at https://perma.cc/6UFR-ZBV4). Persistence pays off. I have found it helpful to have a “feelgood” email folder (archived at https://perma.cc/C3CB-25LU) that I can refer back to when things are difficult.\nDo not forget to laugh and have fun! Graduate school is a challenging job with very high expectations, but it should also be fun. You get to study something that is exciting to you and get paid to do it! To quote Norman Ramsey’s guide for graduate students (archived at https://perma.cc/3WFY-SH3L), “To sustain yourself through difficult times, find research that means a lot to you. Successful researchers find interesting problems and fall in love with them. In operational terms, some Friday nights should be spent having fun out in the world, but if you aren’t also spending some Friday nights having fun with your research, you’re not doing the right research.”"

It is also important that you do not save any visit videos or lab files of any kind to your personal computer, or take screenshots, Snapchats, etc. of any lab-related documents.

An “X” within the variable name is only necessary if there are multiple rounds/blocks for the trial. Thus, if there is only one round of imitation trials, those trials should be simply named test_trials rather than test_trials1.\n\nTrial Totals\n\nTotal Incorrect: total_incorrect_task_trials\nTotal Initially incorrect, but changed to correct: total_initially_task_trials\nTotal Correct: total_correct_task_trials\nTotal No Response: total_noresponse_task_trials\nTotal Uncodeable: total_uncodeable_task_trials\nTotal # of Scoreable Trials Played: total_scored_task_trials\nNote: “task_trials” should be replaced with whether the round/block of trials is imitation_trials, comp_check, practice_trials, or test_trials.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Naming Convention for Radio Buttons\n\nIn order to create calculated fields for trial totals, radio button “Choice Values” must be manually set. To facilitate the process, this should be done after aligning each group of radio buttons for each trial under each TC response for the trial. For example, there should be a column of radio buttons under the “Correct” label within the trial’s grid with each radio button in this column representing the “Correct” choice for a different group of radio buttons. A column of buttons should be present for “Incorrect,” “No Response,” and so forth. Thus, each group of radio buttons should be aligned horizontally, with each button reflecting a different TC response. These groups should then be stacked into a column with each column representing the response across trials. The Choice Values can then be set through the following steps:\n\nSelect the entire column under a certain TC response (ex. select the entire column of radio buttons under “Correct”)\nRight-click on the selected column of radio buttons and select “Properties”\nUnder the “Options” tab, set the “Radio Button Choice” according to the following values:\n\n“Correct” column = 2\n“Incorrect” column = 0\n“Initially incorrect but changed response to correct” column = 1\n“No response” column = -9\n“Uncodeable” column = 9\n\nSet all columns with their appropriate radio button choice value\n\n\nNote: While calculated fields can be derived from different radio button choice values, it is imperative to assign the button choices according to these values. This allows for consistency across pdfs and the ability to smoothly borrow code for calculated fields.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Naming Convention for Check Boxes\nCheck boxes can be named in such a way that they act similar to radio buttons, allowing only one selection out of a group of check boxes.= A group of check boxes can be formatted as radio buttons through the following steps:\n\nInput the same variable name for each check box within the group to be formatted\nRight click on each check box and select “Properties”\nUnder the “Options” tab, set the “Export Value” for each check box according to the following values:\n\n“Correct” column = 2\n“Incorrect” column = 0\n“Initially incorrect but changed response to correct” column = 1\n“No response” column = -9\n“Uncodeable” column = 9\n\nWith each check box named the same but also each with a different export value, the group of check boxes should now operate similar to a group of radio buttons\n\nWithin the group, only one check box should be able to be selected\nAdditionally, the selection should be able to be unselected\n\nWhile both groups of radio buttons and this form of groups of check boxes operate the same way and permit only one selection within the group, groups of check boxes provide an advantage by allowing for deselection of the value. Within groups of radio buttons, as soon as a button is selected, the group of buttons cannot be reset or deselected. This usage of groups of check buttons may be useful going forward and should be considered when creating new coding forms.\n\nNote: Creating calculated fields from groups of check boxes will follow the same procedure as creating calcuated fields from radio buttons. Thus, it is important to ensure the export values for each check box follow the values listed in Step 3."

In nearly all cases the variables being pulled from will be the groups of radio buttons for each trial.\nThe line var v1 = getField(\"variable_group_name\").value defines the selected radio button in “variable_group_name” as var v1 (variable 1) within this script and pulls the choice value from each group\n\nThus, within each getField(), the name of each group of radio buttons should be added in quotations\nNote: The number being pulled through this function directly corresponds to the choice value defined for each radio button in the group of radio of radio buttons. This is why it is crucial to define choice values according to the same naming convention for radio buttons\n\nEach var vX should reflect a trial on the form. Thus, if there are 15 test trials, there should be 15 lines of code from var v1 to var v15 with the name for each group of radio buttons inputed in getField(\"\") for each variable\n\nDefining the Selected Values\nif (v1 == X) { \ntotal = 1;\n} else {\ntotal = 0;\n}\n\nif (v2 == X) {\ntotal2 = 1;\n} else {\ntotal2 = 0;\n}\n\nif (v3 == X) {\ntotal3 = 1;\n} else {\ntotal3 = 0;\n}\n\nif (v4 == X) {\ntotal4 = 1;\n} else {\ntotal4 = 0;\n}\n\nThis portion of code utilizes if/else statements in order to create the total value for each field\nIn v1 == X and each subsequent v == X, the X should be replaced with the choice value of the radio button from the group of radio buttons that corresponds to the desired field you are calculating\n\nFor example, if a total correct field is being calculated, the code should read:\nif (v1 == 2) { \ntotal = 1;\n} else {\ntotal = 0;\n}\n\nif (v2 == 2) {\ntotal2 = 1;\n} else {\ntotal2 = 0;\n}\nBecause a total correct field is being calculated, the choice value of 2 should be inputed as this is the choice value which corresponds to “Correct” (see naming convention for radio buttons)\nThe value of 2 would be inputed for each if/else statement for each variable. Thus, if there were 15 variables, there should be 15 if/else statements v1 == 2 to v15 == 2\n\nThe if/else statement for each variable defines that if the value pulled by the getField() function matches the inputted choice value for the variable then the total for that variable becomes equal to 1. If it does not match, the the total becomes equal to 0.\n\nDefining the Total\n\nevent.value = total + total2 + total3 + total4\n\nThis portion of code defines the calculation to take place in the field\n\nThe event.value determines what appears in the text box\n\nThis line of code adds together the totals defined in the if/else statements. This produces the final calculated value for the field.\nThe number of totals added together should correspond to the number of variables. Thus, if there are 15 trials, then the final line of code should read: event.value = total + total2 + total3 + total4 + total5 + total6 + total7 + total8 + total9 + total10 + total11 + total12 + total13 + total14 + total15\n\nThe following is an example script for a calculated “total_correct_test_trials” field, calculated from 15 trials:\nvar v1 = getField(\"test_trials_1\").value\nvar v2 = getField(\"test_trials_2\").value\nvar v3 = getField(\"test_trials_3\").value\nvar v4 = getField(\"test_trials_4\").value\nvar v5 = getField(\"test_trials_5\").value\nvar v6 = getField(\"test_trials_6\").value\nvar v7 = getField(\"test_trials_7\").value\nvar v8 = getField(\"test_trials_8\").value\nvar v9 = getField(\"test_trials_9\").value\nvar v10 = getField(\"test_trials_10\").value\nvar v11 = getField(\"test_trials_11\").value\nvar v12 = getField(\"test_trials_12\").value\nvar v13 = getField(\"test_trials_13\").value\nvar v14 = getField(\"test_trials_14\").value\nvar v15 = getField(\"test_trials_15\").value\n\n\nif (v1 == 2) {\n  total = 1;\n} else {\n  total = 0;\n}\n\nif (v2 == 2) {\n  total2 = 1;\n} else {\n  total2 = 0;\n}\n\nif (v3 == 2) {\n  total3 = 1;\n} else {\n  total3 = 0;\n}\n\nif (v4 == 2) {\n  total4 = 1;\n} else {\n  total4 = 0;\n}\n\nif (v5 == 2) {\n  total5 = 1;\n} else {\n  total5 = 0;\n}\n\nif (v6 == 2) {\n  total6 = 1;\n} else {\n  total6 = 0;\n}\n\nif (v7 == 2) {\n  total7 = 1;\n} else {\n  total7 = 0;\n}\n\nif (v8 == 2) {\n  total8 = 1;\n} else {\n  total8 = 0;\n}\n\nif (v9 == 2) {\n  total9 = 1;\n} else {\n  total9 = 0;\n}\n\nif (v10 == 2) {\n  total10 = 1;\n} else {\n  total10 = 0;\n}\n\nif (v11 == 2) {\n  total11 = 1;\n} else {\n  total11 = 0;\n}\n\nif (v12 == 2) {\n  total12 = 1;\n} else {\n  total12 = 0;\n}\n\nif (v13 == 2) {\n  total13 = 1;\n} else {\n  total13 = 0;\n}\n\nif (v14 == 2) {\n  total14 = 1;\n} else {\n  total14 = 0;\n}\n\nif (v15 == 2) {\n  total15 = 1;\n} else {\n  total15 = 0;\n}\n\nevent.value = total + total2 + total3 + total4 + total5 + total6 + total7 + total8 + total9 + total10 + total11 + total12 + total13 + total14 + total15"

    "text": "4.6 Breaking Down the Conditional Formatting Calculation Script\nNotice the traditional calculation script is present within this script. However, additional if/else commands are implemented in order to account for the dependence on another variable. Before proceeding with this section, an understanding of the traditional calculation script should be obtained. In the following section, Variable X refers to the variable which is contingent on the value of another variable, Variable Y. Thus, the conditional formatting is described in such a way that the value of a Variable X is dependent on the value of Variable Y. \nThe conditional formatting calculation script features two major alterations:\n\nDefining the Additional Variable\nvar v17= getField(\"variable_Y_group_name\").value\nvar v18= getField(\"variable_Y_group_name2\").value\nvar v19= getField(\"variable_Y_group_name3\").value\nvar v20= getField(\"variable_Y_group_name4\").value\nvar v21= getField(\"variable_Y_group_name5\").value\nvar v22= getField(\"variable_Y_group_name6\").value\nvar v23= getField(\"variable_Y_group_name7\").value\nvar v24= getField(\"variable_Y_group_name8\").value\nvar v25= getField(\"variable_Y_group_name9\").value\nvar v26= getField(\"variable_Y_group_name10\").value\nvar v27= getField(\"variable_Y_group_name11\").value\nvar v28= getField(\"variable_Y_group_name12\").value\nvar v29= getField(\"variable_Y_group_name13\").value\nvar v30= getField(\"variable_Y_group_name14\").value\nvar v31= getField(\"variable_Y_group_name15\").value\nvar v32= getField(\"variable_Y_group_name16\").value\n\nThis addition to the script is necessary in order to accomodate for the additional Variable Y by which the calculated total is contingent\nAn additional 16 variables must be added, one for each of the 16 groups of Variable X (v1-v16). Each of these new var commands corresponds to one of the original 16 var commands for Variable X and pulls each trial’s value for Variable Y upon which the total is dependent.\nThus for a form with 16 test trials, there should be 32 total lines of code: 16 which correspond to the original 16 groups of radio buttons for Variable X which reflect a response for each trial, and an additional 16 which correspond to the manually input response for Variable Y upon which the calculated total is conditional\n\nCreating the Conditional Formatting using If/Else Commands\nif(v17 == Y1){\n    if (v1 == X2){\n            total=1\n    }else{\n            total=0\n    }\n}else{\n    if (v1 == X1){\n            total=1\n    }else{\n            total=0\n    }\n}\n\nif(v18 == Y2){\n    if (v2 == X1){\n            total2=1\n    }else{\n            total2=0\n    }\n}else{\n    if (v2 == X2){\n            total2=1\n    }else{\n            total2=0\n    }\n}\n...\n\nThis alteration to the script utilizes if/else commands to establish contingency on Variable Y\nAs outlined in the Breaking Down the Calculation Script section, the if/else statements operate in the same manner and follow the same procedures. However, notice an additional if/else statement is present for each trial and surrounds the original if/else statement:\nif(v17 == Y1){       &lt;------------ START OF OVERARCHING IF STATEMENT\n    if (v1 == X2){     # Original if/else statement\n            total=1\n    }else{\n            total=0\n    }\n}else{               &lt;------------ START OF OVERARCHING ELSE STATEMENT\n    if (v1 == X1){     # Second original if/else statement\n            total=1\n    }else{\n            total=0\n    }\n}                    &lt;------------ END OF OVERARCHING IF/ELSE STATEMENT\n\nThe overarching if/else statement is centered around the variable which defines the conditional formatting, Variable Y, thus the if(v == Y){ should only reference var v17 to var v32\nWithin the overarching if/else statement, Y1 and Y2 represent the choice value of the field being pulled from for Variable Y\n\nFor the original if/else statements within the overarching if/else statement, X1 and X2 still reflect the desired choice value of the radio button from the group of radio buttons that correspond to the desired field you are calculating for Variable X\n\nThe conditional formatting emerges from defining the Y in if(v == Y){ as Y1 or Y2\n\nNotice, there are two if/else statements within the overarching if/else statement. Each of these secondary if/else statements define a different outcome - in this instance, the outcomes are “if v1 == X2 then total = 1” and “if v1 == X1 then total = 1” Which outcome is selected is dependent on the definition of Y in if(v == Y){.\nThus, for the example script above, if v17 == Y1, then the first outcome of “if v1 == X2 then total = 1” will be the result, but if v17 equals anything else besides Y1, then the second outcome of “if v1 == X1 then total = 1” will be the result\nThe final result is conditional formatting as the calculated total for each trial of Variable X is ultimately dependent on the value of Variable Y"

    "text": "4.7 Conditional Formatting Calculation Script: An Example\nListed below is a specific example where the conditional formatting calculation script is necessary: \n\n4.7.1 The Scenario\nA calculated field for the total number of correct responses out of 16 trials is needed. \nFor each trial, an experimenter taps the table either one time or two times. In response to the experimenter’s administration, the participant is expected to tap the table the opposite number of times. \nIf the experimenter taps the table once, the participant should tap the table twice; if the experimenter taps the table twice, the participant taps the table once. A response is correct if the particpant successfully taps the table the opposite number of times as the experimenter. \nThus, the correct response is not always one tap or two taps. Instead, whether the response is correct is contingent on the experimenter’s administration and how many times the experimenter taps the table. As a result, conditional formatting is necessary in order to calculate the total number of correct responses across the 16 trials.\n\n\n4.7.2 The Variables\n\nVariable X = participant’s responses (the

    "text": "4.8 Time Calculations in Adobe\nCalculating a time based on two other times can be accomplished within Adobe. To do this, custom calculation scripts using the language JavaScript must be implemented.\n\n4.8.1 Creating Time Calculations in Adobe\n\nFirst, ensure all fields from which the time calculations are to be made from or applied to have been formatted into the desired time format. To do this:\n\nRight click on the field and select “Properties”\nNavigate to the “Format” tab\nFor “Select format category:” select Time\nIn the “Time Options” interface that appears, select the desired time format\nRepeat this for every field that the time calculations will be made from or applied to\nThe following calculation script calculates time in the HH:MM:ss format\n\nSelect the field in which the time calculation will occur\nRight click on the field and select “Properties”\nSelect the “Calculate” tab\nSelect the “Custom calculation script:” radio button\nSelect “Edit…” and input the desired time calculation script\n\nThe following script details how to calculate X second intervals based on an inputted starting time. The times within this script follow the HH:MM:ss time format. The following script can easily be modified to calculate different length intervals or to use different time formats.\nvar timestarted = this.getField(\"start_time_field\").valueAsString;\n\nvar timeSplit = timestarted.split(\":\") ;\n\nvar totalSec = ((timeSplit[0]*3600) + (timeSplit[1]*60) + (timeSplit[2]*1));\n\nvar newtotalSec = ((timeSplit[0]*3600) + (timeSplit[1]*60) + (timeSplit[2]*1) + \"INTERVAL LENGTH X\");\n\nhours = Math.floor(newtotalSec/3600);\n\nminutes = Math.floor((newtotalSec % 3600)/60);\n\nseconds = newtotalSec % 60;\n\ntimeOutput = hours + \":\" + minutes + \":\" + seconds;\n\nevent.value = timeOutput\n\nProceed to Breaking Down the Time Calculation Script to gain a greater understanding of the script\n\n\n\n4.8.2 Breaking Down the Time Calculation Script\nvar timestarted = this.getField(\"start_time_field\").valueAsString;\n\nvar timeSplit = timestarted.split(\":\") ;\n\nvar totalSec = ((timeSplit[0]*3600) + (timeSplit[1]*60) + (timeSplit[2]*1));\n\nvar newtotalSec = ((timeSplit[0]*3600) + (timeSplit[1]*60) + (timeSplit[2]*1) + \"INTERVAL LENGTH X\");\n\nhours = Math.floor(newtotalSec/3600);\n\nminutes = Math.floor((newtotalSec % 3600)/60);\n\nseconds = newtotalSec % 60;\n\ntimeOutput = hours + \":\" + minutes + \":\" + seconds;\n\nevent.value = timeOutput\nThe time calculation script can be broken down into three parts:\n\nDefining the Start Time\n\nvar timestarted = this.getField(\"start_time_field\").valueAsString;\n\nvar timeSplit = timestarted.split(\":\") ;\n\nvar totalSec = ((timeSplit[0]*3600) + (timeSplit[1]*60) + (timeSplit[2]*1));\n\nThis portion of the script defines the initial time from which the time calculation is to be done\nThe line var timestarted = this.getField(\"start_time_field\").valueAsString; imports the desired start time from the variable start_time_field. This imported time should be in the HH:MM:ss time format\nThe line var timeSplit = timestarted.split(\":\") ; then removes the colons from this imported time, leaving the time as HH MM ss. This is stored as a new variable, timesplit\nFinally, the line var totalSec = ((timeSplit[0]*3600) + (timeSplit[1]*60) + (timeSplit[2]*1)); converts this imported time to be all in seconds. At this point in the script, the imported start time has now been converted to a total time in seconds\n\nThe following operators are used in this line of code: [0], [1], and [2]\n[0] retrives the first portion of the variable timesplit\n\nThus, timeSplit[0] returns the value of HH from the variable of timesplit\nMultiplying this value of hours by 3600 in turn converts the hours to seconds\n\n[1] retrieves the second portion of the variable timesplit\n\nThus, timeSplit[1] returns the value of MM from the variable of timesplit\nMultiplying this value of minutes by 60 in turn converts the minutes to seconds\n\n[2] retrieves the second portion of the variable timesplit\n\nThus, timeSplit[2] returns the value of ss from the variable of timesplit\nMultiplying this value of seconds by 1 leaves the time in seconds\n\n\n\n\nDefining the New Time\n\nvar newtotalSec = ((timeSplit[0]*3600) + (timeSplit[1]*60) + (timeSplit[2]*1) + \"INTERVAL LENGTH X\");\n\nhours = Math.floor(newtotalSec/3600);\n\nminutes = Math.floor((newtotalSec % 3600)/60);\n\nseconds = newtotalSec % 60;\n\nThis portion of the script defines the new time to be calculated from the start time\nThe line var newtotalSec = ((timeSplit[0]*3600) + (timeSplit[1]*60) + (timeSplit[2]*1) + \"INTERVAL LENGTH X\"); calculates a new time in seconds by adding X amount of seconds to the initial start time in seconds\n\n(timeSplit[0]*3600) + (timeSplit[1]*60) + (timeSplit[2]*1) converts the initial start time to be a total of seconds\n+ \"INTERVAL LENGTH X\" adds X amount of seconds to this start time total of seconds to result in the new desired calculated time\n\nThus, if the desired calculated time is to be 25 seconds after the start time, the line of code should look like the following:\n\nvar newtotalSec = ((timeSplit[0]*3600) + (timeSplit[1]*60) + (timeSplit[2]*1) + 25);\n\n\n\nThe lines of code following this line convert this new total of time of seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds\n\nhours = Math.floor(newtotalSec/3600); converts the new total start time in seconds into hours\n\nThe function Math.floor() rounds the number in hours down, leaving only the number of hours with no decimal value\nThus, if the new total time of seoonds converts into 2.56 hours, the Math.floor() returns a value of 2 hours\n\nminutes = Math.floor((newtotalSec % 3600)/60); converts the new total start time of seconds into minutes\n\nThe operator % is the remainder operator and returns only the remainder after integer division is completed\nThus, newtotalSec % 3600 returns only the remainder of seconds that did not divide wholly into hours. Dividing this value by 60, leaves the remainder in minutes.\n\nseconds = newtotalSec % 60; returns the remainder of seconds that did not divide wholly into hours or minutes\n\nThus, this leaves the number of seconds to be left in HH:MM:ss format\n\nAfter these three lines of code, three new variables have been created: the number of hours, minutes, and seconds in the new total start time of seconds\n\n\n\nDefining the Time Output\n\ntimeOutput = hours + \":\" + minutes + \":\" + seconds;\n\nevent.value = timeOutput\n\nThis portion of the script defines the final time calculated in HH:MM:ss time format\nThe line timeOutput = hours + \":\" + minutes + \":\" + seconds; defines a new variable of the new total time in HH:MM:ss time format\n\nThis line takes the previously defined variables of hours, minutes, and seconds and adds colons between them to give the new total calculated time in HH:MM:ss time format\n\nThe line event.value = timeOutput then defines the new total time in HH:MM:ss to be the output value of the field\n\nThe following is an example script for creating a new calculated time 10 seconds after the start time:\nvar timestarted = this.getField(\"task_start_time\").valueAsString;\n\nvar timeSplit = timestarted.split(\":\") ;\n\nvar totalSec = ((timeSplit[0]*3600) + (timeSplit[1]*60) + (timeSplit[2]*1));\n\nvar newtotalSec = ((timeSplit[0]*3600) + (timeSplit[1]*60) + (timeSplit[2]*1) + 10);\n\nhours = Math.floor(newtotalSec/3600);\n\nminutes = Math.floor((newtotalSec % 3600)/60);\n\nseconds = newtotalSec % 60;\n\ntimeOutput = hours + \":\" + minutes + \":\" + seconds;\n\nevent.value = timeOutput\nNote. When creating multiple time calculated fields, each field should be calculated off of the intitial time. Calculated time fields should NOT be calculated off each other. For example, if five calculated time fields must be created, each 10 seconds apart from each other, one should not calculate each time field 10 seconds based off the previously calculated time. Instead, each field should be calculated based off of the initial start time. Thus, the first calculated field should add 10 seconds to the initial start time. The second calculated field should add 20 seconds based off the initial start time. The third calculated field should add 30 seconds based off the initial start time. And so forth. This ensures that no errors occur from calculating times based off times in fields that are already being calculated.\n\nNote. Time calculated fields cannot be overwritten. One cannot manually overwrite the calculated time in a field with an alternative time. The field will always read the time calculated according to the inputted script. This should be kept in mind when creating multiple field that feature X second consecutive intervals. If at any point the intervals should be interrupted and a new time must be manually entered, it cannot be done. A potential means to work around this issue is found in the Token/Bead Sort example.\n\n\n4.8.3 The Perfect Example: Token/Bead Sort\nThe Token/Bead Sort coding form provides a perfect example of time calculations, action buttons, and hidden fields at play. Token/Bead Sort consists of 18 ten second intervals. All of these intervals occur after a specified start time and should always be 10 seconds apart. However, if an interruption should occur during the task, a new start time must be entered into one of the intervals from which the following intervals should calculated from. Due to the time fields being calculated, the time values cannot be manually overwritten. The following solution is implemented to work around this:\n\nTime calculations are made for each of the initial 18 intervals\n\nEach of these intervals calculate from the intial start time\n\nThus, the first interval calculates ten seconds from the initial start time, the second interval 20 seconds from the start time, the third interval 30 seconds from the start time, etc.\n\nWhen the initial time is inputted, each of these intervals calculate automatically\n\nA second set of text fields are made for each of these 18 intervals\n\nThese fields have no calculations applied to them\nThese 18 fields are set to be hidden from user view\nThese 18 fields serve to allow for manually entry of a time in case of an interruption\nThe 18 fields are positioned over the initial 18 fields which do the contain the calculations\n\nA set of 18 buttons are created, one for each interval\n\nEach button corresponds to an interval and is configured with actions to hide the calculated time interval it corresponds to and show the second text time field which allows for manual entry that it corresponds to\nEach of these buttons serves to hide the calculated time field for the interval in which the interruption occurs and all the following intervals\nEach button also shows the second time text field which allows for manual entry and also reveals the manual entry fields for all the following intervals\nEach of these buttons is also set to be hidden from user view\n\nAt the top of the coding form, the radio buttons for the “Was there an interruption in the task?” question are assigned actions\n\nIf “Yes” is selected, the 18 buttons are revealed and shown to the user\nIf “No” is selected, the 18 buttons are hidden\nThus, when the user selects that an interruption occurred, the 18 buttons appear and allow the user to select the interval in which the interruption occurred. When the button is pressed, the automatically calculated time fields are hidden for that interval and subsequent intervals, and the fields that allow for manual entry are shown for that interval and subsequent intervals. This allows for time calculations to be implemented even when interruptions occur\n\nRefer to the Token/Bead Sort coding form in order to gain further understanding of this setup"

For example, a behavior may be coded for the number of times it occurs at different levels of intensity. If one wants the highest level of intensity the behavior occurred at, regardless of the number of times it occurred, the following script can be utilized:\nNote. The following script was created for a unique situation. Essentially, the script utilizes multiple if/else statements. How to employ if/else statements and conditionals are outlines above.

If there is, the total returns a 5 which significes the second highest level of intensity\nIf the behavior does not occur at the second highest level, it asks whether there is a value for the third highest. If not at the third highest, it asks at the fourth highest, and so forth.\n\nThis script may be modified to be employed in a variety of situations\nThe above script can be found in the Parental Sensitivity and Parental Intrusiveness Coding Forms\n\nThese forms should be studied in order to gain greater understanding of the specific context for which this script was created and how might it be applied to other contexts"

    "title": "Writing Guidelines",
    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Writing Guidelines\nBelow are writing guidelines for the Developmental Psychopathology Lab:\n\nFollow APA style.\nIf you are unsure about grammar, spelling, punctuation, capitalization, etc., follow the UI Editorial Study Guide, where it does not conflict with APA style.\nFollow the style and author guidelines of the target journal; where the style of the target journal differs from APA style and/or the UI Editorial Study Guide, follow the style of the target journal.\nUse EndNote or Zotero for reference management.\nIn empirical papers, include a correlation matrix with descriptive statistics for your model variables.\nAlign decimal numbers in tables. For guidance on how to do this in Microsoft Word, see here (archived at https://perma.cc/KW6J-DQ3Z).\nProvide and interpret effect sizes (e.g., rs, ds, betas), and not just statistical significance.\nReport numbers to two decimal places; report p-values to three decimal places; report percentages to one decimal place.\nKnow the difference between a “hypothesis” and a “prediction”—and use them correctly. A hypothesis is a proposed explanation; it specifies the causal relation between processes. A prediction is “the expected result of a test that is derived, by deduction, from a hypothesis or theory” (Eastwell, 2014; archived at https://perma.cc/8EX4-8JYN). Here is an example of a hypothesis and the resulting prediction:  “We hypothesize that poor language skills lead to physical aggression because they lead to difficulties in (a) using language as a self-regulatory tool resulting in dysregulated behavior, in (b) interactions with peers leading to peer rejection and resulting frustration, and in (c) communicating one’s needs and having one’s needs met leading to frustration and to resorting to other methods to achieve one’s goals. If the hypothesis is true, we predict that children with poorer language skills will show more physical aggression than children with greater language skills.”\nPer APA style (4.22), “while” and “since” should be reserved strictly for their temporal meaning; for non-temporal meanings, use terms such as “whereas” and “because”, respectively.\nPer author guidelines of Child Development (archived at https://perma.cc/7P53-DLVT), use “relationship” to describe social bonds between people, not variables; to describe associations between variables, use “association”, “relation”, “covariation”, or “correlation”.\nReport relevant aspects of reliability (e.g., internal consistency, inter-rater, test–retest/cross-time stability and repeatability) and validity (e.g., convergent, discriminant, incremental, criterion-related) for the measures you are using, including based on evidence from prior studies and based on estimates in the present study—in particular, those that are most relevant to the particular population, context, purpose, etc.\nWhen referring to reliability, validity, or stability, specify the aspect(s) of reliability/validity/stability you are referring to.\n\nFor example, it is important to distinguish between stability of people’s level on a construct across time, or of the mean, variance, or rank-order (individual differences) of a group’s scores on a construct across time, or the stability of the structure of a construct or of the strength of an effect.\n\nAvoid “this”, “that”, “these”, and “those”. They are vague and make the reader work harder. Replace them with their referent.\n“Increase” (or increased) and “decrease” (or decreased) imply change over time. Do not use them to describe differences between groups or associations, unless you are specifically referring to change over time (e.g., greater language ability was associated with decreases in behavior problems over time). Instead, use words such as “higher”/“greater”/“stronger”/“better” and “lower”/“smaller/”weaker”/“poorer”, etc.\nWhen writing the Limitations section, provide thoughtful limitations. As described by Patrick Curran, don’t include a limitation that, if you reversed it, only an ignoramus would endorse it:\n\nCurran: I would love to take credit for this, but a colleague of mine years ago had this great description of. He doesn’t want to see a limitation that if you reversed it, only an ignoramus would endorse it. So he said if the limitations were: “Future research needs to use smaller sample sizes, more homogeneous samples, higher SES”. You reverse the limitation, only an ignoramus would endorse it. That’s not really a limitation. I wanna see real, legitimate, thoughtful limitations. Communicate to me that you’re aware of the limits of what you’re doing, but be thoughtful and realistic, both so that you can telegraph that, but also that you can legitimately lay out where we need to go next.\nHancock: So give me an example of one or two of those limitations that you would think, yep, that’s the kind of thing I wanna see right here.\nCurran: [Jokingly] “We need larger sample sizes and more items.” So maybe we used a series of latent curve models to fit nonlinear trajectories to adolescent substance use over time.

During this process, you are encouraged to register for PSY:4990 or HONR:4990 (Honors Thesis or Project) to account for the time commitment this project requires. If you are interested in conducting an Honors thesis, it is your responsibility to contact Dr. Petersen to set up a meeting (see below). Dr. Petersen’s decision whether to approve your proposal will depend on factors such as whether you are meeting your regular lab expectations, whether you have the time necessary, the quality of your research question and hypotheses, your motivation, and whether you have the skills and aptitude necessary for successfully completing the project.\nTo help keep you on track to finish your project and thesis on this timeline, Dr. Petersen expects you to meet with him once per month. It is your responsibility to schedule the monthly meetings. In addition, it is your responsibility to pair with a graduate student in the lab and to meet regularly (at least monthly) with them to get feedback on your ideas and writing, help with analysis, etc.\nThe first half of the year is spent formulating a research question and hypotheses (based on the research literature), and writing the Introduction and Method sections of the thesis. The second half of the year is spent performing the data analysis to answer the research question, writing the Results and Discussion sections of the thesis, and presenting the findings at a poster conference (see below). The more reading you do, before the “thesis year” begins, and the more you think about what you are interested in, what questions you have, and what gaps are in the literature that you can address with the lab’s data, the more prepared you will be to complete your thesis on this timeline. Note: work related to Honors theses is expected to take place *outside* of your regular 10 hours in the lab. You can get academic credit for your thesis research via the course entitled “Honors Thesis Research” (PSY:4990).\nDr. Petersen expects you to present a research poster on your thesis findings at the UI ICRU Undergraduate Research Festival during the final semester in which you complete your thesis. It is your responsibility to keep track of the registration deadlines for the Undergraduate Research Festival so you do not miss it! Here is information on the UI Undergraduate Research Festival: https://our.research.uiowa.edu/events-0/undergraduate-research-festivals\nYou are expected to follow the Department requirements for Honors theses and for Honors in Psychology, including meeting all deadlines: https://psychology.uiowa.edu/undergraduate/honors-psychology\nYou must have two readers of the thesis who are familiar with the topic. One reader will be Dr. Petersen. You will work with Dr. Petersen to identify a second reader. The second reader should be in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences. You have two options for the format of your thesis defense:\n\nYou have a 30-minute public component followed by an hour-long closed defense. For the public component (i.e., it is open for others to attend), you give a 20-minute presentation of your thesis, followed by a 10-minute question-and-answer session with the attendees. After the public component, you have a closed defense with just your committee (Dr. Petersen and the second reader).\nYou just have the hour-long closed defense, with no presentation or public component.\n\nPlease let Dr. Petersen know which option you prefer for your defense format and schedule it accordingly (1.5 hours for option 1; 1 hour for option 2), making sure to book a room in SLP, PBSB, or STH. You should work with your committee to schedule your thesis defense. Your defense should take place no later than Finals week so you can get Honors credit when you graduate etc. You must send the completed final draft of your thesis to both Dr. Petersen and the second reader at least one week prior to your defense. Read the Cover Page Instructions for how to create your cover page, what you need to have signed at your defense, and what you need to submit."

    "text": "2.1 Overview\nMediation is a causal chain of events, where one variable (a mediator variable) at least partially explains (or accounts for) the association between two other variables (the predictor variable and the outcome variable). In mediation, a predictor (X) leads to a mediator (M), which leads to an outcome (Y). Mediation answers the question of, “Why (or how) does X influence Y? A mediator (M) is a variable that helps explain the assocation between two other variables, and it answers the question of why/how X influences Y. That is, the mediator is the variable that helps explain how/why X is related to Y. In other words, you can think of the mediator as the mechanism that helps explain why X has an impact on Y. The association between X and Y gets smaller when accounting for M. Visually this can be written as:\n\n\n\nMediation\n\n\nwhere X is causing M, which in turn is causing Y. In other words, X leads to M, and M leads to Y. In clinical psychology, we often examine mediation when we investigate why certain therapies cause reductions in psychopathology like depression. That is, what is the mechanism of a therapeutic technique that helps to reduce depression? One can hypothesize that some therapies help increase a client’s self-esteem, which in turn will help to reduce the client’s depression. In this case, increased self-esteem mediates (i.e., helps explain or account for) the effect of the therapy on decreased depression.\nQuestion: Why/how does the therapeutic technique lead clients to experience fewer depressive symptoms?\nAnswer: increased self-esteem\nAs a picture, we can draw this assocation as:\n\n\n\nMediation Example"

In these cases, X and M work together to have an effect on Y; here X does not have a direct effect on M.

    "text": "3.2 Types of Interactions\nThere are two types of interaction effects: cross-over interactions and fan-shaped interactions. Graphically, both types of interaction effects can be identified by the appearance of non-parallel lines at different levels of the moderator. However, the way these lines diverge from one another are what define whether it is a cross-over or fan-shaped interaction.\n\n3.2.1 Cross-Over Interaction\nA cross-over interaction occurs when individuals at different levels of M start at different points on Y, and when interacting with X the effects on Y go in different directions; when looking at a graph of the effects, you can see the lines “cross-over.” A visual representation of this kind of interaction can be displayed in a line graph with two groups:\n\n\n\nCross-over Interaction\n\n\nwhere the predictor/independent variable X is on the x-axis, the outcome/dependent variable Y is on the y-axis, and the different levels/groups of the moderator variable M are represented by the different colored lines in the graph (i.e., the z-axis). Notice the non-parallel lines at different levels of the moderator.\n\n\n3.2.2 Fan-Shaped Interaction\nFan-shaped interactions occur when individuals at different levels of M either start or end near each other on Y, but appear to diverge at different levels of X. For example: there may be an interaction between the presence of Alzheimer’s disease and time when predicting an individual’s verbal memory. Imagine a task where a list of words is repeatedly read to an individual. After completing the task, they are asked to recall as many of those words as possible at various periods of time (e.g., at 5-minute intervals). At first, early on in the assessment (i.e., after the first 5 minutes) the number of words recalled by individuals in both groups (i.e., at different levels of M) may not significantly differ from one another; individuals with and without Alzheimer’s disease appear to recall the same amount of words. However, as more time passes, the interaction effect between time and the presence of the disease becomes more apparent. That is, at later time points (i.e., after 20 minutes) the gap between the amount of words recalled by both groups become significantly different. In this case, the presence of Alzheimer’s disease interacts with the passing of time to cause a faster decline in the number of words recalled. In other words, the number of words recalled over time differs between individuals who have Alzheimer’s versus individuals who do not.\nVisually, this can be displayed in a line graph with two groups:\n\n\n\nFan-Shaped Interaction\n\n\nIn the above example, notice the non-parallel lines at different levels of the moderator. There is a stronger association between the passage of time and number of words recalled for the Alzheimer’s diagnosis group compared to those without Alzheimer’s. For the Alzheimer’s diagnosis group, there is a strong negative association between the passage of time and number of words recalled. For those without Alzheimer’s, there is a weak negative association between the passage of time and number of words recalled. That is, the effect of the passage of time on number of words recalled depends on whether the person has Alzheimer’s. In terms of the number of words recalled, the passage of time matters more for those with Alzheimer’s compared to those without Alzheimer’s.\nQuestion: For whom does the passage of time lead to fewer words recalled?\nAnswer: those with Alzheimer’s"

The Observation Room computer has been set up to combine these recordings into one video file when it saves. In the event that they save separately and result in two separate video files of the full visit, they can be knit together as one side-by-side video by following these steps:\n\nMove the video files to be combined to the folder “Side by Side,” found here: \\\\lc-rs-store24.hpc.uiowa.edu\\lss_itpetersen\\Lab\\Studies\\School Readiness Study\\Videos\\01-Admin\\Side by side\\\nClick the “Convert.bat” file in the same folder\nEnter the name of the video file you want displayed on the left side of the combined video (Camera 1 angle), then press the Enter key on the keyboard\n\nNOTE: You enter the entire file name, including the extension (e.g., 1001video1.mp4)\n\nEnter the name of the video file you want displayed on the right side of the combined video (Camera 2 angle), then press the Enter key on the keyboard\n\nNOTE: You enter the entire file name, including the extension (e.g., 1001video2.mp4)\n\nIf the file is large, the program may take over an hour to combine, but do not close out of the window until it has finished running.

To perform this approach, ffmpeg must be installed on the computer. After installing ffmpeg, make sure the videos are on a local drive on the computer (i.e., not on the lab drive).

    "text": "2.1 Cutting and Creating Clips\nWhen a video requires cutting and subsequent clips must be created, the software, Handbrake, should be utilized. Handbrake allows for easy creation of video clips in .mp4 format from a source video in the .mp4 format. \nNote: Handbrake does not allow for it’s user to scrub through the video within the software. Thus, the needed timestamps for the start and end of the desired clip must be determined before uploading the video into Handbrake. These timestamps will then be entered into Handbrake to create the clip. \nTo create video clips in Handbrake, complete the following steps:\n\nOpen Handbrake\nOn the left side of the screen under the tab titled, “Source Selection,” select File\nSelect the video which requires cutting from its location in the lab drive. The video should now be present in the display and open to editing\nWithin the main display, locate the “Range:” tab. Change the selected option from Chapters to Seconds from the drop-down menu\nTo the right of the “Range:” tab, enter your desired start and end timestamps for the clip within the time input boxes. The start and end timestamps for the desired clip should be determined before uploading the video into Handbrake\nIn the middle of the Handbrake display, under the “Summary” tab, ensure that the “Format:” is selected to MP4. MP4 should automatically be selected, however, if it is not, manually select MP4 from the drop-down menu\nAt the bottom of the screen, next to the “Save As:” title, click the Browse button in order to select the desired folder from the lab drive in which to save the created clip. Additionally, edit the name of the clip to be as needed by altering the name after the final backslash of the selected filepath. Also verify that the name ends in .mp4\nAfter selecting the save location for the video, at the top of the Handbrake display, select the large green play button titled, Start Encode, in order to create the clip\nUpon completion of encoding, view the created video in order to ensure the clip was successfully made with desired start and end times\n\n\n2.1.1 Creating Multiple Clips from the Same Video Simultaneously\nMultiple clips can be made from the same source video and processed simultaneously in Handbrake. \nTo create multiple clips from the same video simulatneously, complete the following steps:\n\nOpen Handbrake\nOn the left side of the screen under the tab titled, “Source Selection,” select File\nSelect the video which requires cutting from its location in the lab drive. The video should now be present in the display and open to editing\nWithin the main display, locate the “Range:” tab. Change the selected option from Chapters to Seconds from the drop-down menu\nTo the right of the “Range:” tab, enter your desired start and end timestamps for the first clip to be made within the time input boxes. The start and end timestamps for the desired clip should be determined before uploading the video into Handbrake\nIn the middle of the Handbrake display, under the “Summary” tab, ensure that the “Format:” is selected to MP4.

Additionally, edit the name of the clip to be as needed by altering the name after the final backslash of the selected filepath. Also verify that the name ends in .mp4\nAfter selecting the save location for the video, at the top of the Handbrake display, select the Add to Queue button in order to add the clip to the queue\nRepeat steps 4-7 for each clip to be made from the source video. Ensure the start and end times are changed appropriately for each clip and the file name for each of the clips is changed and named appropriately\nOnce all clips desired to be made have been added to the queue, select the large green play button titled, Start Queue, in order to create all the clips listed within the queue\nUpon completion of encoding, view the created videos in order to ensure the clips were saved to the correct file location(s) and each clip was successfully made with desired start and end times"

Thus, our program is best aligned with careers in which research will be a key component. We look to admit and train graduate students who have research-oriented career goals. If you have career goals of being a clinician, our program would not be a good fit for you; you would not be happy here.\nGiven our research-focused training, applicants will be most competitive if they have strong research experiences. What will make you most competitive for our program is having lots of high-quality research experience and showing evidence of capabilities to conduct independent research. In general, it is helpful for you to have strong experience with all aspects of the research process—including developing a research question, formulating a hypothesis, developing a study to test your question, conducting the statistical analysis, interpreting the findings, writing up the findings, and presenting the findings to others—so a) you know what you’d be signing up for by joining a research-focused Ph.D. program and b) you are ready to hit the ground running. You will want to show evidence of independent research experiences, such as an Honors project, senior thesis, independent research project, first-authored publications in strong peer-reviewed journals, first-authored posters or presentations at strong national or international conferences, and grant/fellowship submissions—these are just examples (you are not expected to have all of these!)."

    "text": "1 Duties\nDuties for the Lab Coordinator include the following:\n\nParticipant recruitment\nParticipant scheduling\nLongitudinal tracking and retention of participants\nData collection\nData management\nBehavioral coding from video\nSupervision of research assistants\nMaking lab space warm, welcoming, and child and family friendly\nQuality control and ensuring high-quality and efficient procedures\nAttending and contributing at lab meeting\nSupervision of lab staff\nLeading lab meeting\nLab report\n\n\n\n2 Your Schedule\nHere are the expectations regarding your schedule:\n\nYou are in the office for at least 40 hours per week, during regular business hours: 9:00 AM–5:00 PM, Monday through Friday.\nYou may have to work outside regular business hours (early mornings, evenings, or weekends) to run participant visits. These hours are in addition to the standard 40-hour workweek. It is important to me to help protect your time, and I will work with you to try to minimize these instances (e.g., getting research assistants to run visits) to the extent possible, but some visits may require you to help run them because of staffing constraints.\nYou get approval from me in person, by phone, or by email for any deviations from this schedule (working outside those hours, listing more than 40 hours in your log if you log hours, etc.), and update your schedule accordingly in the online calendar. If we discuss the schedule changes in person or by phone, you email me after we discuss to confirm the changes.\nIf your position requires you to log hours, you log hours worked using your Employee Self Service and submit them to Dr. Petersen—your log should not exceed 40 hours in a week.\nThe position involves fully in-person work.\nYou let me and the relevant team members know by Discord if you will not be able to make it in for your regularly scheduled hours.\nYou let me and the relevant team members know in person or by Discord if you are leaving the office (running lab errands, etc.).\nYou keep your schedule in the online calendar up-to-date with any changes.\nYou submit time off (or other) requests to me in person, by phone, or via email (not by Discord) with as much advance notice as possible—and at least 24 hours in advance, if at all possible.\n\n\n\n3 Communication\n\nYou will use Discord (or in person/phone) for most communication (see lab communication guidelines here), but you will use the lab email (i.e., devpsy-lab@uiowa.edu; not your personal email) for all lab-relevant email communication. This makes it easier for us to keep a record of lab-related communication for Dr. Petersen and future lab staff. For personal communication (e.g., asking for time off) or non-lab related email communication, you will use your personal university email (i.e., firstname-lastname@uiowa.edu). If someone contacts your personal university email with lab-related communication, you should reply using the lab email.\nYou respond to team members promptly by email, Discord, or in person (within one business day).\nIf you need time to gather information in response to a Discord message or email, please acknowledge receipt of the message and indicate when you will be able to provide the requested information. At times, I may contact you by email or Discord after hours (if that is when it is most convenient, so that I do not forget to). However, you are *not* expected to respond after hours. I will call you if something is urgent.\n\n\n\n4 Lab Report\n\nWe will have a weekly scheduled one-on-one meeting (in addition to other times I meet with you in the lab).\nYou will submit a report no later than the day before so I can review it before our meeting and come prepared.\nThe report should include:\n\nWhat you have accomplished since last week\nWhat you plan to accomplish in the next week\nItems to discuss, including problems, recommended solutions, and questions\n\n\n\n\n5 Expectations for Everyone in Lab\nIn addition to the expectations described above for the Lab Coordinator, please also read the expectations for everyone in the lab.\n\n\n6 Signature\nPlease download, sign, and email the below document to Dr. Petersen prior to your first day in lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

If you exceed 10 hours during any given week (e.g., helping run lab visits outside of your normal hours), you should work with the Lab Coordinator to determine when you may cut back your lab hours in later weeks. Any request to cut back on hours or change your schedule should be submitted to the Lab Coordinator in person, by phone call (319-353-1977), or via email to the lab email (devpsy-lab@uiowa.edu) by 4:00 pm the day prior to the requested time off. Please give as much advance notice as possible. In case of emergency requests, please reach out to the Lab Coordinator in person or by phone call (319-353-1977). Requests must first be approved by the Lab Coordinator. It is your responsibility to follow up with the Lab Coordinator regarding requests. Do not send requests to change your schedule via Discord. If the request is approved, create a calendar entry on the Busy calendar, as described here.\nUnless otherwise stated, running lab visits is always the top priority. You are expected to arrive 45 minutes before the scheduled start time of visits. If you are asked to help run a lab visit in a given week, then running the lab visit is the prioritized use of your allotted weekly hours. If you are able to run a lab visit, and are asked to do so, we expect that you run the lab visit, even if it means not completing other lab responsibilities for the week; for example, it is okay for coding and entry duties to “pile up” if you are running lab visits.\nYou are responsible for keeping the “RES-DPL-Busy” calendar up to date, including evenings and weekends, and to keep the Lab Coordinator informed of any changes as they occur.\nYou are expected to track your lab hours honestly using the electronic scheduling system. You should diligently clock in and clock out every time you are in lab, and should only be “on the clock” while you are doing scheduled lab-related work or activities.\nIf you come into lab to help run lab visits during university breaks, the hours can count as hours for either the current semester (if you are “under hours” for the semester), or toward the following semester (if you are “over hours” for the semester). Completed lab-related hours count as lab hours no matter when they occur as long as they occur when they are scheduled. Lab hours must be scheduled/arranged with the Lab Coordinator in advance.\nYou are NOT expected to be in lab for regularly scheduled lab hours on university holidays. If holidays occur during the week when lab hours are scheduled (e.g., Labor Day), the Lab Coordinator will manually enter hours for that day.\nYou are expected to schedule non-lab activities (course-related, therapy/medical appointments, extra-curricular, etc.) outside of your scheduled lab hours. However, we understand that this is occasionally not possible. If scheduling an outside activity during your regular lab hours is necessary, you are expected to first discuss this with the Lab Coordinator, to mark yourself as unavailable on the calendar (RES-DPL-Busy), and to work with the Lab Coordinator to determine when to make up the missed hours.\nYou are expected to be available at least two weekday evenings (M–F) per week and at least 8 weekend days per semester to run lab visits that may extend or be scheduled outside of the lab’s normal business hours, which are 9:00am to 5:00pm Monday through Friday. You will be considered “on call” the evenings and weekend days you mark as available (i.e., your scheduled “on-call days”). It is unlikely you will run a lab visit on all of your on-call days, but we may schedule a lab visit on any of your on-call days, in which case you would be expected to help run the lab visit. You are expected to hold your scheduled on-call days available until 24 hours beforehand. If you can no longer help run a visit you have been scheduled for, it is your responsibility to find another RA to trade with you. Both parties are then required to inform the Lab Coordinator of the trade before it is finalized. We will do our best to schedule families during your regular lab hours, however this may not always be possible. We want to ensure, as much as possible, (a) adequate coverage to accommodate families’ schedules and (b) equitable distribution of “after-hours” lab visits. These are the minimum expectations for evening and weekend availability. You are welcome to make yourself available more than two evenings per week and three weekend days per month to help us better meet families’ needs.\nIf you miss lab for an acute illness, the missed hours should be made up during the same semester the missing hours occurred. If you have concerns making up these hours, please reach out to the Lab Coordinator.\n\n\n\nWe appreciate that your classes—including exams and course prep—come first. We will work with you so that your lab schedule does not interfere with your other classes.\nIt is greatly appreciated when RAs are able to run lab visits during breaks because breaks are often when families are available and thus it is very helpful to the lab. RAs who are available and willing to run lab visits during breaks will accrue those hours either for the current or following semester. Running lab visits during breaks is not an expectation of RAs.\nWe will schedule lab visits using the availability schedule you submitted to the Lab Coordinator at the beginning of the semester and the RES-DPL-Busy calendar. We will never expect you to help run lab visits when you have marked yourself as unavailable on the calendar.\nWe will do our best to schedule a similar number of lab visits across RAs. This will ensure RAs receive a similar amount of experience with children/families and that a small set of RAs are not overburdened by lab visits and unable to tend to their other lab responsibilities.\nWe will do our best to schedule families during your regular lab hours. We will only schedule families outside regular lab hours (e.g., evenings/weekends) if necessary.\nWe will never schedule a lab visit outside of normal lab hours with less than 24 hours’ notice to the RAs scheduled to run it.\nWe will work with you to help you identify when you can “cut back” when you let us know that you are over the expected number of hours for that point in the semester."

If scheduling an outside activity during your regular lab hours is necessary, you are expected to first discuss this with the Lab Coordinator, to mark yourself as unavailable on the calendar (RES-DPL-Busy), and to work with the Lab Coordinator to determine when to make up the missed hours.\nYou are expected to be available at least two weekday evenings (M–F) per week and at least 8 weekend days per semester to run lab visits that may extend or be scheduled outside of the lab’s normal business hours, which are 9:00am to 5:00pm Monday through Friday. You will be considered “on call” the evenings and weekend days you mark as available (i.e., your scheduled “on-call days”). It is unlikely you will run a lab visit on all of your on-call days, but we may schedule a lab visit on any of your on-call days, in which case you would be expected to help run the lab visit. You are expected to hold your scheduled on-call days available until 24 hours beforehand. If you can no longer help run a visit you have been scheduled for, it is your responsibility to find another RA to trade with you. Both parties are then required to inform the Lab Coordinator of the trade before it is finalized. We will do our best to schedule families during your regular lab hours, however this may not always be possible. We want to ensure, as much as possible, (a) adequate coverage to accommodate families’ schedules and (b) equitable distribution of “after-hours” lab visits. These are the minimum expectations for evening and weekend availability. You are welcome to make yourself available more than two evenings per week and three weekend days per month to help us better meet families’ needs.\nIf you miss lab for an acute illness, the missed hours should be made up during the same semester the missing hours occurred. If you have concerns making up these hours, please reach out to the Lab Coordinator."

RAs who are available and willing to run lab visits during breaks will accrue those hours either for the current or following semester. Running lab visits during breaks is not an expectation of RAs.\nWe will schedule lab visits using the availability schedule you submitted to the Lab Coordinator at the beginning of the semester and the RES-DPL-Busy calendar. We will never expect you to help run lab visits when you have marked yourself as unavailable on the calendar.\nWe will do our best to schedule a similar number of lab visits across RAs. This will ensure RAs receive a similar amount of experience with children/families and that a small set of RAs are not overburdened by lab visits and unable to tend to their other lab responsibilities.\nWe will do our best to schedule families during your regular lab hours. We will only schedule families outside regular lab hours (e.g., evenings/weekends) if necessary.\nWe will never schedule a lab visit outside of normal lab hours with less than 24 hours’ notice to the RAs scheduled to run it.\nWe will work with you to help you identify when you can “cut back” when you let us know that you are over the expected number of hours for that point in the semester."

    "section": "9.1 Scheduling System Overview",
    "text": "9.1 Scheduling System Overview\nAfter course registration at the end of each semester, RAs are to submit their course schedules for the following semester to the Lab Coordinator. If an RA has a strict, set work schedule, this can be included with the course schedule. We will do our best to accommodate work schedules; however, classes (including lab) take precedence over work schedules. The Lab Coordinator will review everyone’s individual schedules and create a lab schedule that best allows visits to be scheduled, while respecting RA course schedules and—as best as possible—other responsibilities. Once the Lab Coordinator has finalized the lab schedule for the semester, they will email each RA their weekly lab schedule. This weekly lab schedule consists of 10 total hours per week. This includes 9 weekly hours of lab time, during which RAs may run visits, help with recruitment, complete data entry and coding tasks, assist the Lab Coordinator with assigned tasks, etc. Additionally, all RAs are expected to attend a one-hour lab meeting every week when the entire team assembles to discuss lab-related issues and science. Once the semester schedules have been sent out to all RAs, it is expected that RAs schedule other events around their scheduled lab hours to the best of their availability (i.e., there are no major schedule changes that would impact an RA’s scheduled lab hours for the semester).\nBy the first day of the new semester, RAs are expected to submit to the Lab Coordinator their standard weekly availability. This should include all normally occurring weekly availability during which the Lab Coordinator can schedule them to run visits that occur outside of an RA’s normal lab hours. This availability schedule should include at least two available weekday evenings (M–F) per week. The Lab Coordinator will keep a composite schedule of RA weekly availability to use in scheduling visits when additional coverage is needed beyond RA lab schedules. If an RA is scheduled to run a visit during their availability but outside of their normal lab hours, the RA will be notified of the visit details via an invitation to the Outlook calendar event, but the Lab Coordinator will not reach out to them before scheduling to confirm their availability. The RA is expected to accept the invitation to the calendar event in Outlook.\nIf scheduling commitments come up throughout the semester during any time that an RA submitted as part of their weekly availability, they are responsible for adding it to the shared Outlook “Busy Calendar” (RES-DPL-Busy) so that the Lab Coordinator knows not to schedule them. It is acceptable for an RA’s available evenings to vary week to week, but all RAs are expected to maintain at least two available evenings every week. RAs are responsible for any visit they may be scheduled to run during the availability they provide at the beginning of the semester. Therefore, it is imperative that all appointments and events that occur during their normal weekly availability are shared with the Lab Coordinator via the “Busy Calendar” as soon as possible.\nIf an RA has been scheduled for a visit during their availability (including available time on weekdays, available evenings, and chosen weekend days), has been notified of this visit, and cannot run the visit due to an unexpected conflict, the RA is responsible for posting on the #scheduling channel on Discord to ask for a cover. It is the RA’s responsibility to let the Lab Coordinator know who will cover the visit. If unable to find a cover, it is the RA’s responsibility to let the Lab Coordinator know by at least 48 hours before the visit.\nFor information regarding weekend visits, please refer to the section regarding the Weekend On-Call Schedule.\nFor general information regarding the scheduling expectations for undergraduate RAs of the Developmental Psychopathology Lab, please refer to the section on Scheduling Expectations."

    "text": "9.2 Weekend On-Call Schedule\n\n9.2.1 Introduction\nTo ensure that the coverage responsibility for visits scheduled outside of normal lab hours is shared equally among all lab members, RAs are expected to sign up for at least 8 weekend days each semester when they will be “on-call”. Please note, this does not mean that you will be expected to come into lab for every day you sign up. This does mean that if a visit needs to be scheduled on a weekend day, the Lab Coordinator may schedule you to help run that visit without first contacting you to ask if you are available.\nYou are expected to stay available to run visits on the days you are signed up for until 24 hours prior. The Lab Coordinator will not automatically schedule you for a weekend or evening visit without 24 hours’ notice to lab members. The Lab Coordinator may request volunteers to run visits that are scheduled “last minute” (i.e., within 24 hours), but you are not expected to be available for “last-minute” visits unless they occur during your scheduled lab hours. If a weekend visit is scheduled and you are on-call that day, the Lab Coordinator will tag you in a Discord with the details of the visit.\nIf you can no longer help run a visit you have been scheduled for, it is your responsibility to find another RA to trade with you. Ultimately everyone is expected to be on-call for at least 8 weekend days per semester (apart from Advanced Specialists; see the section on RA Advancement).\n\n\n9.2.2 Preparation\nTo ensure the process is as efficient as possible, please bring your calendar with your weekend availability for the semester. Bring a written list of the weekend days you cannot be on-call for that semester.\n\n\n9.2.3 Procedure\n\nThe Lab Coordinator will set up separate meetings with behavioral testing specialists, EEG testing specialists, and data specialists/new RAs during the first week of the semester. At these meetings, the Lab Coordinator will conduct the weekend scheduling.\nEveryone draws a number.\nPass the sign-up sheet around your group from lowest number to highest number, and every RA will sign up for one day per turn. Each round, the order reverses (i.e., snake order). That is, whoever gets the first pick in round 1 gets the last pick in round 2. Continue this process to sign up for days until everyone has signed up for at least 8 days each. Note that this may mean signing up for a day that you are unavailable (in order to sign up for 8 days).\n\nData Specialists and new RAs will sign up for RA slots—the Lab Coordinator will schedule RA and Camera roles interchangeably (i.e. RAs will be randomly assigned either a Camera or RA role by the Lab Coordinator).\nTrained returning RAs (Behavioral Testing Specialists, EEG Specialists, and Data Specialists) should prioritize signing up for visits earlier in the semester first, if possible. When the new RAs complete training for visit roles, they will be able to help with visits later in the semester.\nAfter everyone has signed up for 8 days, RAs will have an opportunity to trade days with each other (see below).\n\nOnce this process is complete, the sign-up form will be kept in the Lab Coordinator’s office and remain there for one week. During this one week, RAs will have the opportunity to make any final adjustments necessary (i.e., trade days with other RAs). RAs must notify the Lab Coordinator of any trades/changes to their weekend sign ups within this week. Remember, at the end of the one week, everyone should still be signed up for a total of 8 days, and everyone will be responsible for helping run any visits that may be scheduled on those days."

    "text": "10.1 Lab Meetings\nLab meetings will take place once per week at a pre-determined time. The Lab Coordinator will choose the weekly lab meeting time based on everyone’s schedules and will try to schedule the meeting for a time when all lab members are available. Lab meeting is the most important time that the team has together every week, because it is the only time that everyone is present, and it helps everyone stay on the same page as part of working as a team. Attending lab meeting is mandatory.\nThe lab meeting is generally divided into two sections:\n\nThe first 15–30 minutes of the meeting is reserved for lab announcements, as well as any updates or questions about the study. If you have questions or suggestions, please raise them.\nThe second half of the meeting is reserved for an article discussion or a professional development workshop.\n\n\n10.1.1 Article Discussion\nEach lab meeting (with the exception of the meetings reserved for professional development workshops), an RA is expected to lead the discussion of a peer-reviewed, empirical research article of their choosing that is related to the interests (broadly defined) of the Developmental Psychopathology Lab. Article discussions serve several purposes:\n\nin the spirit of getting course credit for lab experience, article discussions provide a seminar forum for learning about science\narticle discussions help students connect the work they are conducting in the lab to the broader scientific field\nthey help students gain greater skill in reading and critiquing scientific articles, which helps people be more critical consumers of information in society\nthey provide a space to explore scientific ideas and the potential practical implications of science\nthey provide opportunities to gain skill in leading a discussion, which is an important public-speaking skill\nthey provide opportunities in learning to digest complex concepts and to communicate them in a way that is understandable and relevant to others\nthey provide a nonjudgmental space to get out of your comfort zone and to grow intellectually and professionally\n\nRAs will sign up to lead discussion of an article during the first lab meeting of the semester (new RAs may sign up for lab article discussion during their orientation). The list of those who will be presenting and when they will presenting can be found on the lab schedule that is shared via OneDrive. If there are fewer days available than there are RAs, priority is given to newer RAs or to RAs who have had fewer opportunities to lead the discussion of an article. All lab members are expected to contribute to each discussion.\nBy Monday of the week the article will be discussed, the RA picking the article should post 1) the article PDF (the actual PDF file of the article, not the URL link to the PDF) and 2) the full APA-style reference in the #lab-meetings channel on Discord. For more information on how to find and access articles, see here. For more information on APA formatting, see the resources on the lab drive: \\\\lc-rs-store24.hpc.uiowa.edu\\lss_itpetersen\\Lab\\Miscellaneous\\Professional Development\\General ProfDev Materials\\APA Formatting\\\nThe RA who is leading the discussion of the article should structure the discussion following the format below:\n\nProvide a brief explanation of why you chose the article.\nPresent a brief summary (~2–3 minutes) of the article’s main points (it is not a book report!), in which you describe the study and its key findings.\nSpend the majority of the time (~20–25 minutes) posing questions to elicit discussion. The questions should not be too vague (e.g., do not ask “What did you think of the methods?”), but instead should be specific and aim to elicit an interesting and critical discussion. You can also mention critiques you have, but keep it as question-oriented as possible to elicit discussion.\nSave time (~10 minutes) for big-picture questions pertaining to the implications of the findings for science/practice/policy/life, etc.\n\n\n\n10.1.2 Lab Meeting Scribe\nAn RA will be designated (usually on a volunteer basis) each semester to be the lab meeting scribe. The scribe is responsible for taking notes throughout the meeting. The scribe also sends a brief summary of the important information from the meeting to the entire team via the #lab-meetings channel in Discord after the lab meeting has ended. The scribe also adds the summary to the “Lab Meeting Agendas – Team” in the lab’s OneDrive.\n\n\n10.1.3 Attendance and Absence Policies\nAll members of the team are expected to attend every lab meeting. If an RA is unable to attend a meeting, they are responsible for letting the Lab Coordinator know as far in advance as possible so that the Lab Coordinator can work with the RA to arrange how they will make up the time. They are also responsible for emailing several detailed questions or comments on the article to the presenting student AND to the lab email (devpsy-lab@uiowa.edu) by the day before the meeting to help contribute to the discussion. If advanced notice is not possible, contact the Lab Coordinator as soon as you are able to and explain the absence. The RA is also responsible for reading the lab meeting agenda and summary notes after the meeting to learn what they missed."

    "section": "10.2 Lab Communication",
    "text": "10.2 Lab Communication\nForms of lab communication are described below. Please use Discord for as much communication as possible! Keeping lab-related communication on Discord helps our team work most effectively and efficiently, and it saves time for the Lab Coordinator, Dr. Petersen, and your team members because it allows other RAs to answer questions and allows people to jump in to provide corrective feedback, as necessary.\n\nNon-private lab-related communication (almost all communication)\n\nUse Discord\n\nSee the Discord Checklist\nFeel free to send messages and you can notify particular people if the message is for particular people (@isaac-petersen).\nYou can send pictures and attachments in Discord by using the plus sign next to the message.\nDiscord communication can be informal! We want it to be a fun place to communicate and chat with the team. Feel free to post memes, set up lab-wide social gatherings, etc.\n\n\nPrivate lab-related communication\n\nSend to: devpsy-lab@uiowa.edu\n\nExamples: Sending your course schedule for the upcoming semester, notifying the Lab Coordinator of an absence due to personal reasons/illness, requesting changes to your schedule, asking the Lab Coordinator for a reference, responding to an email that the Lab Coordinator sent to you.\n\n\nCommunication directed specifically to Dr. Petersen rather than to the lab (e.g., to set up a meeting to discuss career goals, honors projects, etc.)\n\nSend email to Dr. Petersen\n\nCommunication directed to the past members of the lab (e.g., to setup a social gathering)\n\nUse Facebook\n\nSee the Social Media Checklist\n\n\nCommunication directed to the public (e.g., to communicate results from a published study)\n\nUse Twitter and Instagram\n\nSee the Social Media Checklist\n\n\n\n\n10.2.1 Resolving Conflicts and Personnel Issues\nIt is inappropriate and unprofessional to gossip about lab personnel (i.e., complaining about someone behind their back to other RAs). If someone gossips to you about concerns/conflicts/complaints with lab personnel, please ask them to deal with the person directly, or to address the issue directly with the chain of command (see below).\nIf the conflict/personnel issue is with a peer, the first step is to attempt to address the problem with your peer directly. If the conflict/personnel issue is with a peer, and you are unable to resolve the problem or you feel that this first step would be too difficult or uncomfortable for you, then please bring this to the attention of your direct supervisor (graduate student, postdoctoral student, or Lab Coordinator). If the conflict/personnel issue is with your direct supervisor and you are unable to resolve the problem or you feel that this first step would be too difficult or uncomfortable for you, then please bring this to the attention of your main supervisor (Dr. Petersen). Please express personnel concerns directly (in person or by email). Do not put personnel grievances in lab reports. We encourage you to express concerns to the chain of command if you feel the issues impair your or the team’s functioning.\n\n\n10.2.2 Discord\n\n10.2.2.1 Getting Started\n\nDownload the “Discord” App to your mobile phone (it is free!)\nYou can also access Discord on any internet browser (https://discord.com): https://discord.com/channels/@me\nIf you do not already have a Discord account, create a Discord account with a password you will remember. You can use either your university email address or a non-university email address. However, regardless of which email you use, make sure that your notifications are set up so that you will receive notifications for lab-related messages.\nOpen the Discord server for the Developmental Psychopathology Lab (Dr. Petersen or the Lab Coordinator should have added you to the workspace prior to your start in lab as part of your onboarding).\nMake sure to add yourself to all the following “Channels”\n\n\n#announcements\n#coding-scoring\n#data-entry\n#data-specialist\n#good-news\n#irb\n#lab-admin\n#lab-design\n#lab-meetings\n#measures\n#opportunities\n#procedures\n#quotes\n#random\n#recruitment\n#research\n#redcap\n#scheduling\n#visits\n#website-socialmedia\n#wiki\n\n\n\n10.2.2.2 How/When to Use\n\nChannels: All channels are a certain category or topic of conversation so that it is easier to locate previous discussions relevant to that topic\n\nTo notify specific people in your message, type “@” and then enter in their username before typing your message (usernames are located on the left side of the screen)\n\n@everyone notifies everyone (only admins can use)\n@channel notifies everyone in the channel\n\n#random: Use this channel if you are running late to lab, or if you have a question or comment that does not fall within the other channel categories; can also put memes or random funny things here!\n\nAttachments: Send pictures and attachments by clicking the plus sign next to the message\nDirect Messages: Do not use direct messages or private threads in Discord. All Discord communication should be in team-facing channels so others can benefit from the information and so we can go back and reference it later. If you need to communicate privately with the Lab Coordinator or Dr. Petersen, please use email (see the section on Lab Communication for more information)\n\nDiscord channels are meant to organize conversations within broad overarching topics, but within each channel we want diverse conversation to span the gamut of each topic. For example, the #coding channel should include conversations ranging from discrepancies between two coders on a given task, to technical discussions about Datavyu, to general questions to the Lab Coordinator and Dr. Petersen about the constructs measured in a given task, to all of the procedures, systems, and programs in between. Think of each channel as a “theme” rather than a specific “topic of conversation.” You should simply choose the channel that seems most relevant to the question or comment you want to share and have at it! It is important to remember that, even though different team members are assigned different tasks within the lab, it does not mean that it is any less important for the whole team to stay informed about the general projects of the lab. We are all collaborating on the same project, on the same team, and working toward the same general goals.\n\n\n\n10.2.3 Notion\nNotion is a shared project management and note-taking workspace. The primary purpose of our Notion board is to have a shared space to organize ongoing coding, scoring, and entry tasks.\nExpected Use:\n\nCoding and scoring teams should use the Coding, Entry, or Scoring teamspaces to keep track of videos that are actively being coded\nRAs should keep track of comments and questions to be referenced during coding team meetings\n\nOptional Use:\n\nRAs may use the Personal Tasks teamspace to keep track of their own to-do list related to lab work\nRAs may choose to keep track of their training progress in the Training Progress teamspace\n\n\n\n10.2.4 Social Media\nThe purpose of our social media pages is to inform the outside world of our research. One to two members of the Data Specialist team are responsible for creating posts. All posts must be approved by the Lab Coordinator.\n\n10.2.4.1 Facebook\nPrivate Facebook Group\nThe purpose of this private group is to communicate with past and future RAs, as well as to organize fun activities outside of lab.\n\nLog on to https://www.facebook.com using your email and password\nGo to ‘Groups’\nClick on ‘Developmental Psychopathology Lab’ (https://www.facebook.com/groups/1483289471691634)\nYou will have to request permission to join the group\nOnce you have been added to the group, you can access the discussion, the members, events, and photos shared to this group\n\nPublic-Facing Facebook Page\nThe purpose of this page is to inform the outside world about the research, inform about changes (e.g., safety precautions, new team members) and provide updates (e.g., new research findings, conferences, grants, events in the lab).\n\nLog on to https://www.facebook.com using your email and password\nLike the lab page: https://www.facebook.com/DevPsyLab\n\n\n\n10.2.4.2 Twitter\nThe purpose of this Twitter account is to post updates with the outside world about things we are working on in the lab. We invite everyone to follow us on this platform, so we can get the word out about what we do!\n\nLog on to https://twitter.com using your personal credentials\nFollow @devpsylab (https://twitter.com/devpsylab)\n\n\n\n10.2.4.3 Instagram\nThe purpose of this Instagram account is to post updates with the outside world about things we are working on in the lab.

Written documentation is important for many reasons, including that it facilitates training, reduces the likelihood of human error, allows us to share our processes with others, and increases replicability. If we are missing written documentation for something, please let us know and help us create a manual or checklist!\nJust as important as creating written documentation is using it! Checklists to remind surgeons to wash their hands significantly reduce infection rates (archived at https://perma.cc/4Q62-ER5T); we are doing much more complicated work than washing hands, so it is crucial to follow our manuals and checklists. When you are training in a new procedure, do not rely just on what other RAs tell you. Despite their best efforts to help you, RAs may sometimes describe procedures incorrectly to you, and it is important to follow what is in the manual. If something is missing, incorrect, or out-of-date in the manual, please let us know so we can fix it."

In order to access this folder, you have to first be granted permission by Dr. Petersen or the Lab Coordinator (which should happen as part of your onboarding when you first join the lab). Once you have permission, you can access the folder here: https://iowa-my.sharepoint.com/personal/itpetersen_uiowa_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fitpetersen%5Fuiowa%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FResearch%2FLab%2FOneDrive\nThis folder contains three subfolders:\n\n“For RA Edit”: The documents in this folder allow for editing by all team members. This folder includes:\n\nLab Meeting Agendas – Team.docx: This is the running agenda for our weekly lab meetings. Every week, the lab scribe will add detailed meeting notes to this document\nLab Meeting Article Sign-Up.docx: This document is used by every RA at the beginning of every semester to sign up for the day they lead the article discussion. RAs can then access it throughout the semester to check which day they are scheduled to present on, but should not alter their sign-up day without first obtaining permission from the Lab Coordinator\nTask Timing Sheet.xlsx: This Excel document is used by all RAs to record their coding progress (see Coding Manual for more information)\n\n“For RA View”: The documents in this folder allow for read-only access by all team members.\n“Lab Reports”: This is where you should save your bi-weekly lab reports throughout the semester. Lab report folders can only be accessed by the RA who owns it, the Lab Coordinator, and Dr. Petersen. Each lab report folder has a subfolder named “Past Lab Reports_HawkID” which should be used to archive old lab reports—in other words, every time you save a new lab report to your root lab report folder, you should move the previous one to the “Past Lab Reports_HawkID” folder."

    "text": "10.5 Lab Drive\n#1 Rule: Never delete any documents or data without explicit permission from the Lab Coordinator, graduate students, or Dr. Petersen first.\n#2 Rule: If you accidentally delete or move documents, folders, etc., contact the Lab Coordinator, graduate students, or Dr. Petersen IMMEDIATELY. We are able to recover deleted items for up to 4 months.\nIf there is an old or outdated document, like an outdated checklist or an old coding form that has since been re-coded, do not delete it. You may move it to an “00-Old” folder (see Folder Designations below), or, if you are unsure where it should be saved, consult your fellow lab members or the Lab Coordinator.\n\n10.5.1 File Naming Conventions\nBecause the Lab Drive contains so many files across so many different tasks, TCs, and areas of the research process, it is imperative that all files are carefully named following a descriptive, standardized naming convention. All file names should be ALL lowercase, except when using the following established lab abbreviations: LV1/2, or T1/2/3/4, or TC/PC/PP/SC.\n\nFor visit-related files in “Coding”, “Entry”, and “Payment” folders, the file name should include: TCID, wave, and task/document type (e.g., 1000_36_consent).\nFor files within “Coded Data”, coding form files should also include which coder the form is from (e.g., 1000_36_grasssnow_coder1).\nFor files within “Scoring”, scoring form files should also include which scorer the form is from (e.g., 1000_36_maps_scorer1).\nFor visit-related files within “Payments”, file names should also indicate which visit or caregiver the receipt is from (e.g., 1000_36_receipt_LV1, 1000_36_W9_SC).\nAny IRB documents in the IRB folder (\\\\lc-rs-store24.hpc.uiowa.edu\\lss_itpetersen\\Lab\\Studies\\School Readiness Study\\IRB\\) that are stamped with an expiration date (e.g., recruitment materials, consents) should also indicate the year in which they are valid (e.g., informedconsent_2018). When these materials expire, they can be moved to the “00-Old” folder within the relevant parent folder.\n\n\n\n10.5.2 Folder Designations\nOld: This file designation is used to store versions of documents that are outdated—this applies both to previous versions of active, updated documents as well as documents that are no longer in use.\nAdmin: This file designation is used to store miscellaneous admin-related documents (e.g., spreadsheets, checklists, etc.) that cannot logically be placed in another folder within the same parent folder. These folders are not meant to be a “junk drawer” to deposit new files, rather they are a clearly identifiable home for important files that do not have another obvious home, so they are not loose in a parent folder. If new documents are created that could logically be paired with a document in a 01-Admin folder, then do create a new folder and move the related file from 01-Admin into the new folder with its related documents. If a new folder needs to be created, contact the Lab Coordinator.\nA Note About Creating New Folders:\nThe RA should ask the Lab Coordinator, Dr. Petersen, and graduate students before creating a new folder within the Lab Drive. RAs are able to create new TCID folders in their check data folders of their coding or entry task, as well as any new folders within their personal folder on the drive.\n\n\n10.5.3 RA Folders\nFor every RA who joins the lab, we create two folders that are only theirs to use: their member folder and their lab report folder. Member folders and lab report folders are named using the RA’s HawkID.\n\n\n10.5.4 Member Folders\nMember folders can be found on the lab drive here: \\\\lc-rs-store24.hpc.uiowa.edu\\lss_itpetersen\\Lab\\Members\\\nMember folders should be used for any lab-related work (excluding lab reports). They can be accessed by anyone in lab, including other RAs, so it is not advisable to save any personal or confidential documents within a member folder. However, if you ever work on a lab-related project (e.g., recruitment material, helping to develop a new task or coding system, etc.) any relevant documents should be saved in your member folder. When RAs graduate from the lab, these folders are archived so if we ever need to go back and find documents used in previous projects we have them saved.\n\n\n10.5.5 Lab Drive Directory—Frequently Used Folders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers\nIndividual RA files, by HawkID\n\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous\nProfessional Development\n\n\n\n\n\nRAs\nRA Lab Hours\nFolders are broken down by Semester and Year, and include RA Lab, Availability, and Weekend On-Call Schedules\n\n\n\n\nRA Task Assignments\nFolders are broken down by Semester and Year, and include Coding, EntryCheck, and Lab Cleaning Schedules\n\n\nStudies\nSchool Readiness Study\nCoding\n\n\n\n\n\nData\n\n\n\n\n\nIRB\n\n\n\n\n\nPayment\n\n\n\n\n\nProcedures\n\n\n\n\n\nRecruitment\n\n\n\n\n\nScoring\n\n\n\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nTraining\nOrientation\nChecklists\n\n\n\n\nREDCap\nVideos\n\n\n\n\n\nPDF text versions of video training information, by topic\n\n\n\nWebsite\nPhotos\nBanner\n\n\n\n\n\nPictures\n\n\n\n\n\nTabs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.5.6 Google Drive\nSometimes, the lab creates documents in Google Drive for purposes such as sharing, professional development workshops, etc. So the lab retains access to these documents, please transfer ownership to Dr. Petersen when creating them. To transfer ownership, right click the document, click “Share”, add Dr. Petersen (isaactpetersen@gmail.com), and select “Transfer Ownership.”"

    "text": "10.9 Tips and Tricks for Interacting with Children in Lab\n\n10.9.1 When Interacting With Families in the Lab\nWe treat our participants like royalty—we would not have a study without them. We strive to ensure families are as comfortable as possible in the lab. To this aim, it is important that we are non-judgmental. Families should not feel like they are being tested. If a family feels they are being tested, they may also feel they have failed if a task does not go as expected. For example, if we instruct a parent not to let their child touch the toys and the child does, we leave open the possibility that a family could be embarrassed.\nIf a family asks you a question such as:\n“Do you ask us to stop our kids from touching the toys to see if they will do it?”\nOur response could be:\n“We are interested in understanding the full range of differences between children and families. We want to simulate as close to a home and school environment as we can. We just ask that you act as you would normally.”\n\n\n10.9.2 How to Give Praise\nSyntax: Praise + Effort + Specific\nAcknowledging:\n\n“I know this game is hard.”\n“I know this game is tricky.”\n\nPraise:\n\n“Thank you for”\n“I appreciate”\n“I really like”\n“I notice”\n“I can see”\n“I can tell”\n“I’m so impressed”\n“I’m proud of you for”\n“I’m so happy with you for”\n“I like it when”\n“Way to”\n“Nice job”\n“You’re doing a nice job”\n“That’s a great way to”\n“You should be proud of yourself for”\n“It’s nice that you are”\n\nEffort:\n\n“doing your best”\n“trying so hard”\n“working so hard”\n“your effort”\n“getting through those”\n“concentrating so hard”\n“kept playing”\n\nSpecific:\n\n“sitting so still like a statue”\n“sitting so quietly”\n“catching the fish”\n“not catching the sharks”\n“sorting the flowers”\n“not touching the mushrooms”\n“sorting the apples”\n“not touching the worms”\n“sorting the sheep”\n\n\n\n10.9.3 How to Guide Children Through Difficult Tasks\n\n10.9.3.1 DOs\nThe following are “Do”s when working with children in the lab:\n\nBuild rapport early\n\nUse comments and compliments more than questions; questions can be perceived as commands\nComment on things they like (e.g., their shoes, hair, shirt, favorite superhero)\nPhysically get down on their level\nFor anxious children: they will know you are safe by judging their parents’ cues, so for an anxious/clingy child, first build rapport with parent and then it will be easier to build rapport with child after they know you’re safe\n\nMake sure the chair is not too big for the child (i.e., their feet solidly reach the floor)\nMake it into a game!\nUse high positivity and energy: be like a “preschool teacher on crack” (in EEG especially)\n\nBoth in terms of verbal AND nonverbal techniques\n\nFocus on the child rather than the script in the EEG visit\n\nWhat you say matters less than how you say it (as long as you correctly explain the rules)\n\nIf the child is not doing what you want, focus on what you expect them to do instead of what you do not want them to do\n\n“Here, hold this toy” or “Keep your hands on the table” instead of “Don’t touch the…”\n\nUse specific praise (“Nice job sitting so still!”) rather than general praise (“Nice job!”)\nPraise effort, not outcome\n\n“Thank you for trying so hard on these” instead of “Nice job answering these”\n\nUse distraction and redirection (e.g., talking to the child about the movie when putting on the EEG net)\nModel appropriate behavior\n\nSit and watch the screen during the task\n\nHelp the child feel more comfortable with the task\n\nPut the EEG cap on yourself (or on a parent)\nLet them touch the EEG cap\n\nGive them choices we’re okay with\n\n“Would you rather wear the red cape or the blue cape?”\n\nUse Grandma’s Law:\n\n“When you finish catching the fish, you can have some candy.”\n“First sit down in your chair, and then we’ll play the game.”\n\nHave the child take breaks\n\nphysical exercise (e.g., doing wiggles or jumping jacks) or playing a game can help children re-focus\n\nGive the child juice/candy/snacks (if the parent is okay with that)\n\n\n\n10.9.3.2 DON’Ts\nThe following are “Don’t”s when working with children in the lab:\n\nDon’t interrogate children while building rapport\n\nInstead: use compliments and questions (see above)\nComment on the activity, compliment the child, offer chandy, sharing things about yourself to invite conversation\n\nDon’t ask commands in the form of a question (“Can you sit up in your chair?”)\n\nInstead: Be polite but firm. (“Sit up in your chair” or “Please sit up in your chair” or “Let’s sit up in your chair.”)\n\nDon’t frame things in the negative (or the absence of negative)—i.e., don’t provide reassurance (“It’s going to be okay” or “It’s not going to hurt.”)\n\nInstead: frame things in the positive (“Let’s put on the special ocean cap to be just like Jamie so we can play the fun games!”)\n\nDon’t provide feedback/correction in the “negative” (no/not/don’t) form\n\nInstead: direct the child to what they CAN/SHOULD do\n\nDon’t ask yes/no questions to “no birds”\n\nInstead: Give them choices we’re okay with (see above)\n\nDon’t draw attention to the child’s distress or allow it to shake you up; don’t apologize\n\nInstead: Distract, redirect, and be positive—children respond to your verbal and nonverbal cues!\n\nDon’t praise outcome or performance (“person praise”)\n\nInstead: Praise effort or perseverance of the child (“process praise”); see above"

This envelope will only include compensation for the lab session in which they participate, not compensation for parking.\nA separate envelope with exactly $10 in $1 bills will be kept in the file drawer where the locked cashbox resides. This money will be designated for parking compensation. If this cash is added to the participant’s compensation on a given day, the TCID, date, and amount needs to be written on the extra cash envelope, and this amount should be reflected on payment receipts.\nAfter payment has been made, relevant data will be entered in the Excel spreadsheet ledger (in the payments folder in on the lab drive). The Lab Coordinator is responsible for entering cash data in the ledger.\nEach participant and the RA will sign a payment receipt form confirming that they received payment. Receipt must include TCID/Wave, data of service, amount distributed, and signatures of both participant and RA handling payment."

    "text": "1 What Does SROP Entail?\nThe University of Iowa’s Summer Research Opportunities Program (SROP) is an eight-week program designed to provide undergraduate students from underrepresented backgrounds with in-depth research experiences. As part of the SROP program, you will conduct an independent research project and will present your findings at a University of Iowa undergraduate research conference. To help you accomplish this, our goal is to get you set up as quickly as possible with our data so that you can formulate a research question and hypothesis, identify and extract the relevant data available, learn and perform the data analysis to test your question, and put together an abstract and poster for the SROP presentation—all on the eight-week timeline.\nFor more informaton on the UI SROP Program, see here: https://grad.uiowa.edu/gsb/srop\n\n\n2 Lab Expectations\nThe following are lab expectations for SROP students:\n\nYou and Dr. Petersen will have a weekly one-on-one meeting to ensure you are making progress on your independent research project\nYou will attend weekly lab meeting\nWhenever you are not in a SROP program meeting, you will be working in the lab (during regular business hours; 9am–5pm Monday through Friday)\nYou will let us know, in advance, if you will be late to your scheduled shift or will not be able to make your scheduled shift\n\n\n\n3 Resources\nThe focal project of the lab’s work is an ongoing longitudinal study, the School Readiness Study, that follows children from 3–7 years of age to better understand how self-regulation and externalizing problems develop, from a bio-psycho-social perspective. For more information on the study, you are encouraged to read papers from the project, view the available measures, examine the Data Dictionary, and see the pre-registered hypotheses. These resources are available on the project page for the School Readiness Study. For information on which statistical test to use, see the statistical decision tree in the lab’s Data Analysis Guides. For information on how to conduct data analysis, see the relevant sections of the lab’s Data Analysis guides on SPSS or jamovi. For how to set up your folder structure, see the following page: https://devpsylab.github.io/LabWiki/honors.html\n\n\n4 Expectations for Everyone in Lab\nIn addition to the expectations described above for SROP students, please also read the expectations for everyone in the lab.\n\n\n5 Signature\nPlease download, sign, and email the below document to Dr. Petersen prior to your first day in lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

    "text": "We invite you to apply to join the Developmental Psychopathology Lab!\n\n1 About Being a Research Assistant in Our Lab\nResearch Assistant (RA) positions are available for credit or volunteering initially, but there may be opportunities for paid positions for RAs who have been in the laboratory for a while and demonstrated their commitment and interest. Research assistants will gain experience with many lab procedures (e.g., collecting data during child lab visits, data management, and video coding of parent–child interactions). There are also opportunities to complete honors theses for students who are interested and who have been in the lab for a while. Positions in our laboratory may be particularly interesting and greatly beneficial for those who plan to enter graduate programs in clinical psychology or developmental psychology. Experience with young children is highly desirable. Completion of introductory courses in research methods and statistics is desirable but not required. Expectations for undergraduate RAs are described here.\n\n\n2 How Long Am I Expected to Stay in Lab?\nGiven the extensive amount of training involved in our lab, RAs are expected to make a commitment to work in the lab for at least two semesters for three credit hours (9 hours/week of working in lab, plus 1 hour weekly lab meeting) each semester. That said, we are especially interested in prospective RAs who are interested in working in the lab for much longer than that. The longer the RA stays in lab, the more opportunities become available to them in terms of advanced training, advancement, leadership, and independent research projects (e.g., Honors theses) that can help them be competitive for graduate/professional school and jobs. To take on a more advanced training role, RAs are expected to commit to at least three semesters.\n\n\n3 How Do I Apply?\nTo apply, please submit the following application: Undergrad Research Assistant Application\n\n\n4 Questions\nIf you have questions, please contact the Developmental Psychopathology Lab at: devpsy-lab@uiowa.edu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

In this project, we place special emphasis on the development of neural functioning, as measured by electroencephalography/event-related potentials (EEG/ERP), and how neural development influences the development of children’s self-regulation and externalizing problems. EEG is a method of measuring meaningful differences in children’s self-regulation through ERPs—EEG activity that occurs in response to stimuli—which may be a powerful way of reliably detecting patterns of brain activity that predict behavioral outcomes."
