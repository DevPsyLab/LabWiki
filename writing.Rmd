# Writing Guidelines

Below are writing guidelines for the Developmental Psychopathology Lab:

1. Follow APA style
1. Follow the style and author guidelines of the target journal; where the style of the target journal differs from APA style, follow the style of the target journal
1. Use EndNote or Zotero for reference management
1. In every paper, include a correlation matrix with descriptive statistics for your model variables
1. Provide and interpret effect sizes (e.g., *r*s, *d*s, betas), and not just statistical significance
1. Per APA style (4.22), "while" and "since" should be reserved strictly for their temporal meaning; for non-temporal meanings, use terms such as "whereas" and "because", respectively
1. Per [author guidelines of *Child Development*](https://www.srcd.org/research/journals/child-development/child-development-submission-guidelines#APA), use "relationship" to describe social bonds between people, not variables; to describe associations between variables, use "association", "relation", "covariation", or "correlation"
1. When submitting a manuscript to a journal, submit any supplemental appendices as a PDF (not as a Word file)
1. When submitting a manuscript to a journal, follow the lab's [open science](openScience.html) guidelines.
For instance, see the section on "[Manuscript Submission to a Journal](openScience.html#journal)."
