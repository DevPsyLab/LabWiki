# Overview

We, as a lab, value and strive to advance the mission of [open science](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/icd.2315) to improve the accessibility, reproducibility, and replicability of science.
As such, all lab members are expected to conduct research transparently and to promote reproducibility.
This includes, but is not limited to, pre- or co-registering studies, sharing analysis scripts and data, using version control (GitLab), submitting [preprints](https://psyarxiv.com) when submitting a manuscript to a journal, and providing support for other labs' attempts to replicate and reproduce our findings.
Our lab's template for projects on the Open Science Framework (OSF) is located here[^1]: https://osf.io/4w9sv.

# Pre-Registration

# Sharing Data, Analysis Scripts, and Research Materials

## Data Dictionary {#dataDictionary}

For each study, we create a Data Dictionary with the following columns:

- Variable Name
    - the variable name in the data file
- Form Name
    - the instrument or measure that the variable comes from
- Human-Readable Variable Name
    - a more easily readable version of the variable name
- Data Type
    - the format of the values in the column (e.g., string, binary, integer, numeric, date, time, etc.)
- Variable Type
    - whether the scale of measurement is nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio
- Measurement Unit
    - the conceptual unit that is being measured (e.g., seconds, level, count)
- Allowed Values
    - the allowed values for a variable and (if possible), what conceptual level each value corresponds to (e.g., 0 = Male; 1 = Female)
- Description
    - conceptual description of the variable
- Definition
    - definitions of abbreviations, conceptual defintions of terms, mathematical definitions of how a variable is calculated, etc.
- Notes
    - additional notes about the variable and how it is calculated
- References
    - references for the measure and/or variable

Data Types include:

- string
    - include letters or other characters (and possibly numbers)
- factor
    - categorical variable with letters and/or numbers
- binary
    - 0/1
- integer
    - whole numbers (never decimals)
- numeric
    - numbers
- date
    - `MM/DD/YYYY`; e.g., 06/24/2020
- time
    - `HH:MM:SS` (e.g., 01:30:24), or `HH:MM` (e.g., 05:24), or `MM:SS`
- date-time
    - `MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS` (e.g., 06/24/2020 01:30:24)

Variable Types include:

- nominal
    - distinct categories
- ordinal
    - ordered categories
- interval
    - ordered with meaningful distances
- ratio
    - ordered with meaningful distances and an absolute zero

Measurement Units include:

- ID
    - participant identification (ID) numbers
- count
    - number of something (e.g., number of children in the household)
- group
    - categories that reflect different groups (e.g., female vs male)
- instance
    - nominal categories that do not reflect groups
- yes/no
    - 0 = No; 1 = Yes
- ratio
    - ratio of two variables (one variable divided by another variable)
- USD
    - U.S. dollars ($)
- option
    - categories that reflect participant's choice among multiple options
- location
    - categories that reflect different locations
- state
    - categories that reflect a status
- degree
    - the degree of
- level
    - the level of
- grade
    - school grade
- date
    - `MM/DD/YYYY`; e.g., 06/24/2020
- time
    - `HH:MM:SS` (e.g., 01:30:24), or `HH:MM` (e.g., 05:24), or `MM:SS`
- date-time
    - `MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS` (e.g., 06/24/2020 01:30:24)
- milliseconds
- seconds
- minutes
- hours
- days
- months
- years
- percentile
- item

**Style Guide:**

When specifying a range of allowed values (e.g., 3–7), use an en dash (–) instead of a hyphen (-); an en dash is technically correct; in addition, spreadsheets often read 3-7 as March 7th, but they correctly read 3–7

# Version Control

We use [GitLab](https://research-git.uiowa.edu) for version control.
See our [lab's guide for using GitLab](https://devpsylab.github.io/DataAnalysis/git.html).
Our lab's template for GitLab repositories is located here[^1]: https://research-git.uiowa.edu/PetersenLab/Template.

# Preprint

When submitting a manuscript to a journal, also submit a preprint to [PsyArXiv](https://psyarxiv.com).

# OSF

The [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io) (OSF) is a website for hosting pre-registrations, data, analysis code, research-related materials, and pre-prints to improve replicability and reproducibility of findings.
For each paper project, create a new repository on the OSF and add the relevant contributors, including Dr. Petersen.
Our lab's template for projects on the Open Science Framework (OSF) can be found here[^1]: https://osf.io/4w9sv.

## Components

Create a component in the OSF project repository for the following components:

- Pre-registration
- Data
- Data Dictionary
- Analysis Code
- Research Materials
- Preprint

### Pre-registration

### Data

To help protect participant anonymity, it is important to anonymize participant IDs so their data cannot be stitched together across papers.
To anonymize participant IDs, use the following script and change the seed for every paper so that a given participant gets a different anonymized code each time.

[https://research-git.uiowa.edu/PetersenLab/Template/-/blob/master/OSF/Code%20to%20anonymize%20participant%20ID.R](https://research-git.uiowa.edu/PetersenLab/Template/-/blob/master/OSF/Code%20to%20anonymize%20participant%20ID.R)

### Data Dictionary

For each paper project, we export a `.csv` file with the subset of the [Data Dictionary](#data-dictionary) variables used for that specific paper.
We upload that `.csv` file to the OSF.

### Analysis Code

### Research Materials

### Preprint

## Create View-Only Links for Anonymous Peer Review

With your project open, go to Settings (top-right) → View-Only Links → Add.
Then check "Anonymize".
Then you can share that URL.
