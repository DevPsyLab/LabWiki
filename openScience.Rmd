# Overview

We, as a lab, value and strive to advance the mission of [open science](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/icd.2315) to improve the accessibility, reproducibility, and replicability of science.
As such, all lab members are expected to conduct research transparently and to promote reproducibility.
This includes, but is not limited to, pre- or co-registering studies, sharing analysis scripts and data, using version control (GitLab), submitting [preprints](https://psyarxiv.com) when submitting a manuscript to a journal, and providing support for other labs' attempts to replicate and reproduce our findings.
Our lab's template for projects on the Open Science Framework (OSF) is located here[^1]: https://osf.io/4w9sv.

# Pre-Registration

# Sharing Data, Analysis Scripts, and Research Materials

# Version Control

We use [GitLab](https://research-git.uiowa.edu) for version control.
See our [lab's guide for using GitLab](https://devpsylab.github.io/DataAnalysis/git.html).
Our lab's template for GitLab repositories is located here[^1]: https://research-git.uiowa.edu/PetersenLab/Template.

# Preprint

When submitting a manuscript to a journal, also submit a preprint to [PsyArXiv](https://psyarxiv.com).

# OSF

The [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io) (OSF) is a website for hosting pre-registrations, data, analysis code, research-related materials, and pre-prints to improve replicability and reproducibility of findings.
For each paper project, create a new repository on the OSF and add the relevant contributors, including Dr. Petersen.
Our lab's template for projects on the Open Science Framework (OSF) can be found here[^1]: https://osf.io/4w9sv.

## Components

Create a component in the OSF project repository for the following components:

- Pre-registration
- Data
- Data Dictionary
- Analysis Code
- Research Materials
- Preprint

### Pre-registration

### Data

To help protect participant anonymity, it is important to anonymize participant IDs so their data cannot be stitched together across papers.
To anonymize participant IDs, use the following script and change the seed for every paper so that a given participant gets a different anonymized code each time.

[https://research-git.uiowa.edu/PetersenLab/Template/-/blob/master/OSF/Code%20to%20anonymize%20participant%20ID.R](https://research-git.uiowa.edu/PetersenLab/Template/-/blob/master/OSF/Code%20to%20anonymize%20participant%20ID.R)

### Data Dictionary

### Analysis Code

### Research Materials

### Preprint

## Create View-Only Links for Anonymous Peer Review

With your project open, go to Settings (top-right) → View-Only Links → Add.
Then check "Anonymize".
Then you can share that URL.
