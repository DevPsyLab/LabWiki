# Terms

These models go by a variety of different terms:

- hierarchical linear model (HLM)
- multilevel model (MLM)
- mixed effects model
- mixed model

# Overview

https://isaactpetersen.github.io/Principles-Psychological-Assessment/reliability.html#mixedModels

# Assumptions

The within-group errors:

1. are independent
2. are identically normally distributed
3. have mean zero and variance sigma-squared
4. are independent of the random effects

The random effects:

5. are normally distributed
6. have mean zero and covariance matrix Psi (not depending on the group)
7. are independent for different groups
