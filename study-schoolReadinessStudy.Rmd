The School Readiness Study is a longitudinal study that follows children from 3â€“7 years of age to better understand how self-regulation and externalizing problems develop, from a bio-psycho-social perspective.
In this project, we place special emphasis on the development of neural functioning, as measured by electroencephalography/event-related potentials (EEG/ERP), and how neural development influences the development of children's self-regulation and externalizing problems.
